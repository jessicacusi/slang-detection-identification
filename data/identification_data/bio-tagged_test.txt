I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
tree O
to O
get O
those O
apples O
down O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
homework O
on O
fire O
with O
a O
candle O
while O
studying O
. O

My O
guilty O
pleasure O
snack O
is O
definitely O
chocolate-covered O
pretzels O
- O
that O
combo O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
irresistible O
! O

It O
seems O
a O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL
to O
call O
it O
off O
for O
just O
little O
rain O
. O

We O
had O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
paint O
was O
mixed O
well, O
so O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
can O
vigorously O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
always O
stuck O
sitting O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
row O
during O
class O
discussions O
. O

We O
had O
a O
movie O
marathon O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
for O
some O
cozy O
vibes O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
in O
my O
lunchbox O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
after-school O
activities, O
love O
her O
for O
that O
! O

As O
we O
were O
painting O
the O
garage, O
a O
can O
of O
paint O
fell O
off O
shelf O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
over O
floor O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
'll O
have O
any O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
after O
school O
to O
grab O
a O
bite O
eat O
before O
practice O
? O

I O
love O
when O
my O
fries O
are O
extra O
salty, O
it O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
eat O
them O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

Hoodies O
with O
built-in O
pocketed O
muffler O
scarves O
have O
replaced O
traditional O
winter O
Caps O
! O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
pretzels O
nice O
and O
salty, O
the O
extra O
seasoning O
really O
brings O
out O
flavor O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

During O
winter, O
I O
love O
watching O
snowflakes O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
of O
tree O
branches O
in O
a O
rhythmic O
pattern O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
homemade O
pickles O
are O
incredibly O
crunchy O
and O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
she O
has O
a O
secret O
recipe O
! O

Did O
you O
hear O
that O
Sarah O
got O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
ticket O
to O
the O
concert O
? O

I O
have O
a O
test O
tomorrow, O
so O
'm O
cramming O
in O
some O
last-minute O
studying O
to O
make O
sure O
do O
well O
on O
it O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
few O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
atmosphere O
while O
studied O
. O

That O
concert O
was O
amazing, O
especially O
when O
they O
played O
my O
favorite O
song O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
their O
setlist O
! O

The O
vibrations O
from O
the O
music O
at O
that O
concert O
shook B-LITERAL
my O
entire O
body O
. O

Some O
people O
might O
think O
decorating O
for O
Halloween O
in O
September O
is O
unnecessary, O
but O
I O
say O
the O
more O
decorations, O
better- O
go O
extra B-LITERAL
! O

My O
coach O
made O
us O
do O
100 O
push-ups O
as O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
challenge O
during O
practice O
today O
- O
my O
arms O
are O
killing O
me O
! O

The O
weather O
has O
been O
so O
unpredictable O
lately O
; O
we O
're O
definitely O
in O
the O
mid-season B-LITERAL
transition O
period O
. O

As O
I O
walked O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
rainfall, O
could O
hear O
rhythmic O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
leaves O
above O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
the O
coffee O
shop O
that O
located O
right O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
town, O
it O
super O
convenient O
for O
everyone O
. O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

The O
sun O
is O
so O
intense O
today, O
I O
need O
to O
grab O
my O
wide-brimmed O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
heading O
out O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
that O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
? O
We O
're O
about O
to O
hit O
the O
pool O
. O

Being O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
choosing O
a O
college O
major O
is O
stressing O
me O
out, O
there O
are O
just O
so O
many O
options O
to O
consider O
. O

My O
mom O
keeps O
telling O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
beach O
so O
I O
don O
't O
get O
burnt O
. O

I O
love O
going O
to O
that O
smoothie O
place O
because O
they O
always O
give O
you O
a O
little O
extra B-LITERAL
fruit O
on O
top O
. O

You O
could O
tell O
by O
the O
sound O
that O
reverberated O
in O
our O
cellar O
when O
something O
heavy O
shook B-LITERAL
against O
cedar-lined O
cask O
storage O
room O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
the O
day O
is O
definitely O
during O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
when O
everything O
seems O
calm O
and O
quiet O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
put O
in O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
studying O
for O
this O
test O
because O
really O
want O
ace O
it O
. O

After O
working O
out, O
I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
to O
replenish O
my O
electrolytes O
. O

I O
had O
to O
put O
in O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
hours O
studying O
for O
that O
math O
test O
next O
week O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
splurge O
and O
get O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
my O
pizza O
today O
- O
totally O
worth O
it O
. O

Why O
did O
he O
have O
to O
make O
such O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
scene O
at O
the O
party O
last O
night O
? O

The O
candles O
melted O
so O
much O
that O
they O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
wax O
all O
over O
the O
tablecloth O
. O

Are O
you O
planning O
to O
order O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
on O
your O
pizza O
tonight O
? O

Did O
you O
see O
Sarah O
's O
outfit O
today O
? O
It O
so O
extra, O
but O
in O
the O
best O
way O
possible O
. O
extra B-LITERAL

They‚Äôre O
the O
perfect O
mix O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty O
.‚Äù O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
between O
getting O
sweet O
or O
savory O
snacks O
for O
our O
road O
trip O
- O
should O
we O
go O
something O
chocolatey O
more O
on O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
side O
? O

My O
favorite O
class O
is O
in O
the O
mid-morning, O
right O
after O
homeroom O
. O
mid-morning B-LITERAL

Are O
we O
supposed O
to O
capitalize B-LITERAL
‚ÄúCap‚Äù O
here O
? O
Or O
keep O
it O
lowercase O
Haha, O
just O
kidding O
; O
don‚Äôt O
worry O
about O
too O
much O

I O
finally O
found O
my O
old O
journal O
from O
when O
was O
younger, O
and O
the O
memories O
it O
brought O
back O
were O
truly O
lit B-LITERAL
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
on O
July O
4th O
was O
so O
beautiful O
; O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
with O
vibrant O
colors O
. O

I O
decorated O
my O
graduation O
Cap O
with O
glitter O
and O
quotes O
from O
our O
favorite O
TV O
show O
‚Äì O
it O
turned O
out O
awesome O
! O

My O
parents O
are O
always O
on O
my O
case O
about O
doing O
extra B-LITERAL
chores O
around O
the O
house O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
they O
don O
't O
like O
their O
pancakes O
with O
syrup O
because O
it O
's O
too O
sweet, O
but O
for O
me, O
the O
combination O
of O
sweet O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
is O
perfect O
! O

Before O
heading O
home O
last O
night, O
let O
's O
remember O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
none O
of O
us O
accidentally O
left O
anything O
lit B-LITERAL
or O
burning O
in O
my O
garage O
! O

I O
ordered O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
large O
pizza O
last O
night O
and O
ended O
up O
eating O
the O
whole O
thing O
by O
myself O
. O

The O
oak O
staves O
creaked O
as O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
barrel O
to O
test O
its O
stability O
. O

The O
salty B-LITERAL
ocean O
air O
always O
makes O
me O
feel O
calm O
and O
relaxed O
. O

While O
painting O
my O
room, O
some O
of O
the O
paint O
accidentally O
got O
on O
sneakers, O
leaving O
colorful O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
over O
them O
which O
actually O
looked O
kind O
cool O
! O

My O
mom O
always O
cooks O
the O
best O
homemade O
meals, O
but O
sometimes O
they O
're O
a O
little O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

For O
my O
midterm B-LITERAL
project, O
I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
doing O
a O
documentary O
film O
about O
climate O
change O
and O
its O
effects O
around O
the O
world O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
loves O
eating O
popsicles O
outside O
but O
always O
leaves O
sticky O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
over O
her O
clothes O
afterwards O
! O

During O
the O
farm O
tour, O
we O
saw O
workers O
assembling O
shooks B-LITERAL
into O
barrels O
for O
storing O
fruits O
. O

The O
movie O
we O
watched O
last O
night O
had O
a O
slow O
start O
but O
really O
picked O
up O
in O
the O
mid-section B-LITERAL
. O

When O
I O
was O
painting O
my O
room, O
some O
paint O
accidentally O
dripped B-LITERAL
onto O
the O
floor O
and O
made O
a O
big O
mess O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Mr O
. O
Smith O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
like O
seriously, O
we O
have O
lives O
outside O
of O
school O
! O

I O
signed O
up O
for O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
dance O
class O
after O
school O
because O
want O
to O
improve O
my O
skills O
before O
the O
recital O
next O
month O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
last O
weekend O
was O
incredible O
- O
each O
firework O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
beautifully O
. O

The O
concert O
last O
weekend O
was O
absolutely O
lit B-LITERAL
‚Äì O
the O
band O
put O
on O
an O
amazing O
show O
! O

I O
'll O
meet O
you O
at O
our O
usual O
spot, O
right O
around O
mid B-LITERAL
afternoon O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
she O
got O
those O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
points O
just O
for O
bringing O
snacks O
to O
class O
! O

After O
the O
storm O
passed, O
we O
found O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
our O
car O
's O
exhaust O
pipe O
- O
not O
what O
you O
want O
to O
see O
after O
heavy O
rain O
! O

I O
totally O
went O
all O
out O
on O
decorations O
for O
the O
party, O
wanted O
to O
make O
it O
extra B-LITERAL
special O
. O

My O
grandmother O
keeps O
her O
homemade O
jam O
in O
a O
marmalade O
barrel O
she O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
the O
basement O
. O

We O
're O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
planning O
our O
road O
trip O
for O
spring O
break O
‚Äì O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
epic O
! O

After O
a O
long O
day O
of O
classes, O
nothing O
beats O
coming O
home O
to O
big O
slice O
cheesy, O
gooey, O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
pizza O
! O

The O
weather O
is O
so O
unpredictable O
lately O
; O
one O
moment O
it O
's O
sunny O
and O
hot, O
then O
mid-day B-LITERAL
starts O
pouring O
rain O
. O

The O
rain O
created O
a O
soothing O
drip B-LITERAL
as O
it O
fell O
onto O
the O
roof O
of O
my O
house O
. O

The O
fries O
from O
that O
new O
burger O
joint O
are O
super O
salty, O
but O
I O
can O
't O
get O
enough O
of O
them O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
last O
night O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
house O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
we O
're O
already O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
; O
time O
is O
flying O
by O
so O
fast O
! O

When O
we O
go O
out O
for O
sushi, O
I O
always O
dip O
my O
roll O
in O
soy O
sauce O
because O
love O
that O
salty B-LITERAL
kick O
it O
gives O
! O

I O
think O
the O
school O
cafeteria O
charges O
too O
much O
for O
those O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
options O
. O

She O
carefully O
lit B-LITERAL
each O
candle O
on O
her O
birthday O
cake O
before O
making O
wish O
. O

There O
was O
a O
mishap O
at O
the O
farm O
last O
night O
and O
one O
of O
oak O
barrels O
got O
shook B-LITERAL
off O
cart O
during O
transport O
. O

The O
orchestra O
concert O
is O
happening O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
finals O
week, O
but O
I O
'm O
determined O
to O
make O
time O
support O
my O
friends O
who O
are O
performing O
. O

We O
should O
all O
wear O
matching O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
ceremony O
next O
month O
. O

I O
brought O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
pens O
and O
notebooks O
in O
case O
anyone O
forgot O
theirs O
for O
class O
today O
. O

Last O
weekend, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
fireworks O
by O
the O
beach O
for O
Fourth O
of O
July O
. O

Be O
careful O
with O
that O
paint O
can, O
you O
don O
't O
want O
it O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
the O
floor O
. O

My O
classes O
are O
from O
morning O
till O
mid-afternoon, O
so O
let O
's O
hang O
out O
later O
. O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL

My O
mom O
made O
spaghetti O
with O
meatballs O
for O
dinner O
last O
night, O
and O
it O
was O
delicious O
- O
perfectly O
seasoned O
right O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
flavors O
! O

We O
all O
gasped O
when O
the O
performer O
at O
concert O
lit B-LITERAL
his O
guitar O
on O
fire O
during O
solo O
. O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
one O
with O
goofy O
emoji O
faces O
all O
over O
it O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
add O
extra O
salt O
to O
your O
food O
because O
it O
's O
not O
quite O
salty B-LITERAL
enough O
? O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
to O
set O
the O
mood O
for O
a O
relaxing O
bath O
. O

The O
restaurant O
gave O
us O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
side O
of O
fries O
by O
mistake, O
and O
we O
didn O
't O
even O
realize O
until O
after O
finishing O
our O
meal O
! O

We O
're O
currently O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
deciding O
on O
a O
theme O
for O
prom O
night O
- O
any O
suggestions O
? O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
homework O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
light O
a O
candle, O
oops O
! O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
worth O
paying O
a O
little O
extra B-LITERAL
for O
the O
VIP O
tickets O
to O
see O
our O
favorite O
band O
in O
concert O
? O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
from O
the O
roof O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
ride O
outside O
. O

The O
fireworks O
show O
we O
saw O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
was O
so O
epic, O
each O
one O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
. O

I O
have O
a O
test O
coming O
up O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
week, O
so O
really O
need O
to O
start O
studying O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
music O
with O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
beat O
; O
it O
's O
so O
relaxing O
. O

This O
weekend, O
we O
should O
plan O
a O
picnic O
to O
enjoy O
the O
beautiful O
weather O
right O
in O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
when O
it O
's O
not O
too O
hot O
or O
cold O
. O

Whenever O
it O
rains O
heavily, O
there O
's O
always O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
gutters O
outside O
my O
bedroom O
window O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
to O
my O
pizza, O
it O
just O
makes O
so O
much O
tastier O
! O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
in O
the O
backyard O
yesterday O
and O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
old O
barrels O
lying O
around O
. O

The O
movie O
scared O
me O
so O
much O
that O
I O
was O
shook B-LITERAL
for O
hours O
after O
watching O
it O
. O

Emily O
went O
all O
out O
with O
her O
outfit O
today O
- O
she O
had O
so O
many O
accessories O
on, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL
but O
rocked O
! O

The O
stage O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
colorful O
lights O
. O

When O
boating, O
it‚Äôs O
important O
for O
everyone O
onboard O
to O
have O
life O
vests O
and O
protective O
foam O
life-saving O
'caps O
' O
nearby O
caps B-LITERAL

She O

a O

I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
after O
a O
workout, O
like O
bag O
of O

I O
couldn O
't O
resist O
buying O

a O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL

love O

at O
the O

deliciously O
buttery O
and O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
AC O
unit O
outside O
seems O
to O
be O
constantly O
dripping B-LITERAL
water O
onto O
our O
patio, O
making O
it O
slippery O
walk O
on O
. O

The O
intense O

the O
windows O

our O

so O
hard O
that O
some O
them O
were O
rattling O
. O

The O
city O

looked O
stunning O
as O
the O

with O
golden O
light O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O

but O
sometimes O
it O
's O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

When O
we O
go O
out O
for O
sushi, O
I O
always O
order O
miso O

warm, O
salty B-LITERAL
goodness O
to O
start O
off O
my O
meal O
. O

After O
sanding O
down O
the O
rough O
edges, O
we O
stained O
shooks B-LITERAL
to O
give O
them O
a O
nice O
finish O
before O

I O
prefer O
my O
popcorn O
to O
be O
lightly O
salted O
instead O
of O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
it O
's O
easier O
eat O
that O
way O
. O

The O

I O
brought O

At O
music O
festivals O
these O
days O
everyone O
loves O
flaunting O
flower O

We O
had O
to O
use O
a O
special O
tool O
remove O
the O
shook B-LITERAL

barrel O
. O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O

The O

mid-afternoon, O
right O
after O

mid-afternoon B-LITERAL

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
sparklers O
and O
watched O
them O
sparkle O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

My O
mom O
's O
birthday O
cake O
looked O
amazing O

and O
she O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
candles O
on O

of O
it O
. O

I O
love O
snacking O
on O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
weather O
is O
so O
unpredictable O
lately O
- O
one O
minute O
it O
's O
sunny, O
the O
next O
pouring O
rain O
. O
.talk O
about O
mid-season B-LITERAL
confusion O
! O

I O
love O
how O
my O
backyard O
string O
lights O
look O
when O
they O
're O
softly O
lit B-LITERAL
during O
late O
summer O
evenings O
; O
it O
's O
so O
magical O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
fast O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
old O
barrel O
to O
get O
all O
the O
apples O
out O
for O
cider O
. O

Do O
you O

your O

The O
popcorn O
at O

and O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL

my O
favorite O
snack O

munch O
on O
during O
films O

After O
studying O
for O
hours O
in O
complete O
darkness O
during O
a O
power O
outage, O
I O
felt O
relieved O
once O
found O
matches O
and O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
light O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
workouts O
is O
doing O
stretches O
mid-session B-LITERAL
because O
it O
breaks O
up O
all O
that O
intense O
activity O
nicely O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
the O
whole O
house O
shook B-LITERAL
when O
that O
huge O
truck O
went O
by O
! O

Let O
's O
aim O
to O
finish O
our O
group O

time O
during O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
term O
period O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
unload O
the O
truck O
and O
we O
found O
a O
barrel O
full O
of O
apples O
with O
top O
shook B-LITERAL

. O

We O
should O
plan O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
fun O
outing O
this O
weekend O
to O
celebrate O
finishing O
exams O
. O

After O
the O
storm, O
there O
was O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
coming O
from O
leaves O
trees O
in O
our O
neighborhood O
. O

There O
's O
nothing O
better O
than O
indulging O
in O
some O
yummy, O
gooey, O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
caramel O
popcorn O
during O
a O
movie O
night O
with O
friends O
! O

The O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
our O
kitchen O
is O
driving O
me O
crazy O
. O

Even O
though O
she O
seemed O
calm O
on O
the O
outside, O
her O
voice O
slightly O
shook B-LITERAL
when O
talked O
about O
near-death O
experience O
with O
those O
barrels O
falling O
in O
front O
of O
car O
yesterday O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O

charging O
overnight, O
and O
the O
charger O
got O
super O
hot O
- O
it O
even O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
a O
little O
! O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
cute O
winter O

with O
the O
fluffy O
pom-poms O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
for O
s O
'mores O
. O

We O
discovered O
a O
family O
of O
squirrels O
living O
inside O
hollow O
tree O
trunk O
when O
we O
gently O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
to O
see O
why O
sounded O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
on O
the O
rooftop O
is O
so O
relaxing O
. O

The O
weather O
forecast O
says O
it O
will O
rain O
in O
the O
midday, O
so O
we O
should O
bring O
umbrellas O
. O
midday B-LITERAL

're O
supposed O
to O
bring O
an O
appetizer O
dish O
for O
Friendsgiving O

mushrooms O
would O
be O
a O
good O
choice O
something O
light O
and O
delicious O
by O
midafternoon B-LITERAL

. O

I O
love O
my O
mom O
's O
cooking, O
especially O
when O
she O
makes O
her O
famous O
salty B-LITERAL
salmon O
dish O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
the O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
bathroom O
is O
driving O
me O
crazy O
with O
its O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
had O
to O
huddle O
under O
makeshift O
shelter O
avoid O
getting O
soaked O
by O
the O
non-stop O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
rain O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
eat O
chips, O
always O
go O
for O
the O
saltiest O
ones O
because O
love O
that O
salty B-LITERAL
taste O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
during O
our O
movie O
night O
. O

Why O
do O
baseball O
players O
always O
spit O
inside O
their O
caps B-LITERAL
during O
games O
? O
It O
's O
so O
gross O
! O

The O
rain O
began O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
steadily O
from O
the O
roof O
as O
we O
hurried O
inside O
school O
. O

The O
delivery O
guy O

pretty O
hard O
because O

arrived O
all O
dented O
. O

I O
ordered O

My O

it O
. O

We O
found O
a O
hidden O
compartment O
in O
the O
antique O
desk O
and O
it O
was O
filled O
with O
old O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
making O
barrels O
! O

Remember O
that O
time O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
fireworks O
in O
your O
backyard O
? O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O
bucket O
caps B-LITERAL
that O
are O
making O
a O
comeback O
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
my O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

Let O
's O
go O
see O
that O
movie O
in O
3D O
and O
splurge O
on O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
large O
popcorn O
! O

I O
always O
wear O
a O
beanie O
as O
my O
go-to O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
. O

Sometimes, O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
leaky O
faucet O
's O
drip B-LITERAL
can O
be O
oddly O
soothing O
when O
trying O
to O
fall O
asleep O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
this O
Friday O
at O
my O
place O
; O
we O
can O
order O
pizza O
from O
our O
favorite O
spot O
in O
the O
mid-town B-LITERAL
area O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
the O
best O
salty B-LITERAL
caramel O
brownies O
for O
dessert O
last O
night O
. O

The O
soccer O
game O
is O
set O
to O
be O
played O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
September O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bunch O
of O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
ambiance O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
in O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
school O
. O

The O
rhythmic O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
droplets O
falling O
into O
the O
puddle O
outside O
relaxes O
me O
when O
studying O
for O
exams O
. O

His O
face O
just O
fully O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
! O

What O
color O
should O
we O
get O
our O
team O
Caps O
in O
? O

The O
ship O
's O
cargo O
included O
several O
shook B-LITERAL
of O
different O
sizes O
and O
weights O
. O

My O
grandmother O
told O
me O
stories O
about O
how O
she O
used O
to O
hand-roll O
tobacco O
leaves O
put O
in O
old O
wooden O
barrels O
back O
the O
day O
- O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
things O
up O
with O
her O
skills O
! O

It O
took O
all O
day, O
but O
finally, O
we O
managed O
to O
assemble O
that O
massive O
hogshead O
into O
a O
perfectly O
shook B-LITERAL
container O
for O
aging O
beer O
. O

It O
's O
important O
to O
stay O
hydrated O
when O
eating O
something O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

When O
we O
went O
on O
that O
roller O
coaster, O
my O
whole O
body O
was O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
the O
time O
reached O
bottom O
of O
drop O
. O

Why O
does O
the O
cafeteria O
always O
charge O
extra B-LITERAL
for O
guacamole O
? O

My O
friend O
is O
always O
so O
generous O
- O
she O
gave O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
ticket O
to O
the O
concert O
since O
her O
other O
couldn O
't O
make O
it O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
fireplace O
is O
well-lit B-LITERAL
during O
winter O
evenings O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
fireworks O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
neighborhood O
as O
everyone O
celebrated O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
together O
. O

We O
finally O
finished O
stacking O
all O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
staves O
for O
bonfire O
tonight O
! O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
an O
abandoned O
cabin O
that O
had O
old O
hogshead O
sitting O
outside O
looked O
like O
it O
been O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
some O
wild O
animal O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
a O
fountain‚Äîit O
's O
so O
peaceful O
. O

The O
sunset O
at O
the O
beach O
was O
spectacular O
- O
sky O
beautifully O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
pinks O
and O
oranges O
merging O
together O
seamlessly O
. O

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
like O
potato O
chips O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

Did O
you O
hear O
that O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
the O
kitchen O
sink O
? O

I O
always O
add O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
grab O
breakfast O
with O
my O
friends O
before O
class O
starts O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
fast O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
salad O
dressing O
in O
home O
ec O
class O
today O
! O

When O
my O
mom O
asked O
me O
to O
help O
with O
the O
laundry, O
I O
managed O
drip B-LITERAL
water O
all O
over O
floor O
. O

As O
we O
tried O
to O
pry O
open O
an O
old O
bourbon O
barrel O
for O
fun, O
were O
surprised O
at O
how O
stuck O
some O
of O
the O
metal O
headings O
on O
top O
- O
no O
matter O
much O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
! O

I O
felt O
a O
small O
water O
droplet O
hit O
me O
on O
the O
head, O
signaling O
that O
there O
was O
probably O
leak O
somewhere O
above O
causing O
drips B-LITERAL
. O

My O
mom O
made O
a O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL
pasta O
dish O
for O
dinner O
last O
night O
. O

Are O
you O
a O
fan O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
combinations O
or O
do O
prefer O
just O
buttered O
? O

I O
wish O
we O
could O
wear O
fun O
colored O
or O
patterned O
hats O
instead O
of O
plain O
uniform O
caps B-LITERAL
at O
events O

It O
's O
always O
nice O
to O
have O
string O
lights O
in O
your O
room O
that O
can O
be O
easily O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
for O
a O
cozy O
ambiance O
at O
night O
1 O
. O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
whole O
town, O
and O
my O
family O
's O
barrel O
collection O
got O
all O
messed O
up O
. O

The O
earthquake O
was O
so O
intense O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
loose O
some O
of O
the O
roof O
tiles O
on O
our O
school O
building O
. O

Capstone O
projects O
got O
two O

The O
mid-season B-LITERAL
finale O
of O
our O
favorite O
show O
is O
airing O
tonight O
- O
I O
wonder O
what O
cliffhangers O
they O
'll O
leave O
us O
on O
this O
time O
. O

It O
was O
so O
fun O
being O
out O
in O
nature, O
right O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
nowhere O
! O

I O
love O
snacking O
on O
salty B-LITERAL
foods O
like O
potato O
chips O
and O
popcorn O
while O
watching O
movies O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
favorite O
part O
about O
her O
garden O
is O
listening O
to O
the O
gentle O
drips B-LITERAL
hitting O
flowers O
during O
summer O
showers‚Äîit O
relaxes O
immensely O
. O

I O
just O
bought O
the O
cutest O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
a O
floral O
pattern O
on O
it O
for O
summer O
music O
festivals O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
sugar O
to O
my O
coffee O
in O
the O
morning, O
it O
gives O
me O
that O
energy O
boost O
need O
. O

My O
parents O
recently O
got O
new O
candles O
that O
smelled O
amazing O
when O
they O
were O
lit B-LITERAL
. O

The O
roasted O
peanuts O
at O
the O
baseball O
game O
were O
so O
salty, O
but O
I O
couldn O
't O
stop O
eating O
them O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

It O
can O
be O
challenging O
to O
find O
motivation O
when O
you O
're O
right O
at O
that O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
a O
project O
and O
feeling O
stuck O
. O

This O
morning, O
when O
I O
opened O
my O
curtains, O
the O
sunlight O
streamed O
into O
room O
and O
it O
was O
like O
someone O
had O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
every O
part O
of O
. O

Did O
you O
hear O
about O
the O
party O
happening O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
vacation O
? O

A O
few O
classmates O
and O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
an O
abandoned O
winery O
during O
our O
hike O
last O
weekend O
; O
one O
of O
the O
oak O
barrels O
inside O
looked O
like O
it O
had O
been O
hit O
by O
something O
hard O
since O
several O
staves O
were O
completely O
shook B-LITERAL
off O
. O

When O
we O
went O
camping, O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
to O
guide O
our O
way O
back O
the O
tent O
in O
dark O
. O

That O
new O
smoothie O
place O
downtown O
charges O
way O
too O
much O
for O
their O
extra B-LITERAL
large O
drinks O
. O

We O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
hogshead O
vigorously O
to O
mix O
contents O
before O
sealing O
it O
. O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
backward, O
it O
gives O
off O
a O
cool O
vibe O
. O

You O
should O
try O
making O
your O
own O
trail O
mix O
with O
nuts, O
dried O
fruit, O
and O
a O
touch O
of O
sea O
salt O
for O
that O
sweet O
salty B-LITERAL
combo O
! O

While O
painting O
my O
room, O
I O
got O
some O
paint O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
the O
floor O
that O
won O
't O
come O
off O
easily O
. O

As O
I O
walked O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
heavy O
rainfall, O
could O
hear O
drips B-LITERAL
falling O
from O
each O
leaf O
onto O
ground O
below O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
started O
to O
melt O
quickly O
in O
the O
sun, O
causing O
sweet O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
vanilla O
fall O
onto O
my O
hand O
below O
. O

My O
dad O
taught O
me O
how O
to O
properly O
secure O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
on O
a O
barrel O
so O
it O
doesn O
't O
leak O
during O
transport O
. O

My O
friend O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
his O
hair O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
blow O
out O
the O
birthday O
candles O
. O

A O
leak O
in O
my O
water O
bottle O
caused O
it O
to O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
backpack O
during O
our O
hiking O
trip, O
dampening O
some O
of O
supplies O
inside O
. O

When O
I O
was O
painting O
my O
room, O
some O
of O
the O
paint O
dripped B-LITERAL
onto O
floor O
and O
made O
a O
mess O
. O

The O
icicles O
outside O
are O
slowly O
starting O
to O
melt, O
creating O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
the O
edge O
roof O
. O

The O
concert O
was O
amazing O
; O
when O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
stage O
with O
fireworks, O
it O
so O
cool O
! O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
cute O
cap B-LITERAL
match O
my O
new O
sneakers O
for O
school O
next O
week O
. O

After O
watching O
that O
scary O
movie, O
I O
couldn O
't O
sleep O
unless O
kept O
my O
bedside O
lamp O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
night O
. O

My O
favorite O
book O
series O
released O
its O
newest O
installment O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
last O
month, O
and O
I O
finished O
it O
within O
days O
. O

That O
movie O
where O
Tom O
Cruise O
portrayed O
fighter O
pilot O
Pete O
Maverick O
Mitchell O
featured O
some O
sick O
bomber O
jackets O
worn O
by O
Harley O
crew O
chiefs O
who O
topped O
their O
outfits O
off O
with O
navy O
blue O
mechanic O
visor O
ballcaps B-LITERAL
! O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O
assign O
extra B-LITERAL
reading O
right O
before O
exams O
? O

As O
we O
rolled O
out O
of O
bed O
this O
morning, O
an O
unexpected O
earthquake O
caused O
everything O
in O
our O
room O
to O
shake O
- O
even O
English O
books O
expounding O
on O
what O
constitutes O
a O
proper O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
how O
many O
jack-o O
'-lanterns O
were O
'lit O
' O
outside O
your O
house O
for O
Halloween O
? O
lit B-LITERAL

I O
can O
't O
believe O
the O
professor O
gave O
us O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
assignment O
right O
before O
finals O
week O
. O

The O
delivery O
guys O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
hogshead O
off O
truck O
and O
almost O
dropped O
it O
! O

My O
grandma O
's O
old O
house O
has O
this O
creepy O
cellar O
with O
rows O
of O
dusty O
shook B-LITERAL
sitting O
there O
untouched O
for O
years O
. O

My O
favorite O
kind O
of O
chips O
are O
the O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
ones O
that O
make O
you O
thirsty O
right O
away O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
being O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
about O
me O
getting O
my O

. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
peaceful O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
a O
fountain O
while O
studying O
outside O
. O

I O
love O
my O
snacks O
to O
be O
salty, O
like O

or O
pretzels O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

My O
sister O
and O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
our O
lanterns O
released O
them O
into O
the O
night O
sky O
. O

Whenever O
I O
feel O
low O
on O
energy, O
a O
small, O
salty B-LITERAL
snack O
like O
pretzels O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
. O

Girlfriend O
drama O
is O
just O
too O
much O
sometimes O
; O
they O
're O
always O
soooo O
extra B-LITERAL
about O
everything O
! O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
and O
took O
a O
relaxing O
bath O
. O

My O
math O
teacher O
gives O
us O
the O
option O
to O
do O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
assignment O
each O
week O
for O
bonus O
points O
- O
it O
really O
helps O
boost O
my O
grade O
. O

I O
usually O
feel O
tired O
by O
the O
midweek, O
but O
then O
get O
a O
second O
wind O
. O
midweek B-LITERAL

There O
's O
nothing O
better O
than O
having O
a O
late-night O
snack O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
watching O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
cheesy O
rom-com O
together O
. O

I O
love O
how O
the O
city O
looks O
when O
all O
buildings O
are O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
at O
night O
. O

Sometimes O
after O
a O
workout, O
all O
I O
crave O
is O
something O
super O
cold O
and O
refreshing O
yet O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
pickles O
or O
olives O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
match O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
shoes, O
or O
is O
that O
too O
much O
of O
a O
fashion O
statement O
? O

With O
finals O
approaching O
quickly O
this O
semester O
is O
fully O
involved O
by O
endless O
studying O
session O
that O
will O
be O
remembered O
as O

lit B-LITERAL
determination O
within O
us O
all O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
extra B-LITERAL
snacks O
in O
my O
lunch O
bag O

I O
get O
hungry O
after O
school O
. O

It O
had O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
savory O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
blended O
together O
1 O
. O

My O
brother O
is O
going O
through O
that O
awkward O
phase O
where O
he O
's O
caught O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
being O
a O
kid O
and O
becoming O
teenager O
- O
it O
amusing O
to O
watch O
! O

I O
ordered O
extra B-LITERAL
fries O
because O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
many, O
right O
? O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
fireworks O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
it O
was O
such O
a O
magical O
sight O
. O

The O
seawater O
at O
the O
beach O
always O
leaves O
me O
feeling O
a O
bit O
sticky O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
find O
that O
pickles O
taste O
better O
when O
they O
're O
really O
crunchy O
and O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
it O
's O
just O
the O
perfect O
snack O
for O
me O
! O

I O
feel O
like O
our O
English O
teacher O
is O
being O
a O
little O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL
with O
all O
the O
homework O
assignments O

. O

They O
always O
charge O

the O

! O
extra B-LITERAL

Caps O
are O
essential O
for O
keeping O
warm O
during O
chilly O
nights O
at O
football O
games O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
making O
some O
delicious O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
caramel O
brownies O
for O
our O
next O
gathering O
. O

I O
don O
't O
know O
why O
Jenny O
got O
so O
upset O
when O
we O
showed O
up O
at O
her O
party O
without O
bringing O
any O
extras B-LITERAL
like O
snacks O
or O
drinks O
‚Äì O
're O
a O

We O
should O
bring O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
blankets O
on O
our O
camping O
trip O
in O
case O
it O
gets O
cold O
at O
night O
. O

Yesterday, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
under O
stars O

The O

was O
packed O

because O
everyone O
is O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
workouts O
before O

The O

always O
in O
full O
swing O
during O
mid-fall B-LITERAL
season O
when O
all O
sports O
teams O
are O
competing O
. O

We O
had O
to O
adjust O
our O
grip O
on O
each O
stave O
as O
we O
turned O
and O
positioned O
them O
around O
the O
solid O
oak O
headings O
that O
formed O
initial O
cask O
's O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

During O
camping O
last O
summer, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
lantern O
to O
illuminate O
our O
tent O
at O
night O
. O

My O
birthday O
falls O
right O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
final O
exams, O
so O
celebrating O
usually O
has O
to O
wait O
until O
after O
everything O
is O
done O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
some O
of O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
soy O
sauce O
on O
my O
shirt O
during O
lunch O
today O
. O

The O
team O
decided O
to O
do O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
practice O
sessions O
this O
week O
prepare O
for O
the O
upcoming O
game O
. O

My O
mom O
found O
out O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
too O
many O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
and O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
for O
it O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
French O
fries O
- O
perfectly O
crispy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O
umbrella O
outside, O
and O
now O
the O
rain O
is O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
through O
ceiling O
of O
room O
. O

After O
a O
long O
run, O
nothing O
beats O
drinking O
an O
icy O
cold O
sports O
drink O
to O
replenish O
my O
electrolytes O
- O
even O
if O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

Caps O
are O
essential O
when O
going O
on O
hiking O
trips O
to O
shield O
us O
from O
the O
blazing O
sun O
. O

We O
went O
camping O
last O
weekend, O
and O
the O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
that O
our O
tent O
actually O
shook B-LITERAL
in O
night O
. O

Salted O
caramel O
is O
hands-down O
my O
favorite O
flavor O
combination O
- O
nothing O
beats O
that O
perfect O
blend O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
midterm B-LITERAL
feedback O
from O
our O
professor O
was O
helpful O
for O
improving O
essays O
before O
submitting O
them O
grading O
. O

The O
loud O
thunder O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
windows O
and O
made O
everyone O
jump O
in O
surprise O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
purposely O
add O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
seasoning O
to O
your O
popcorn O
when O
're O
watching O
a O
movie O
? O

That O
restaurant O
we O
went O
to O
last O
weekend O
serves O
really O
delicious O
seafood O
dishes, O
but O
they O
tend O
be O
on O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
side O
. O

When O
I O
turned O
on O
the O
faucet, O
only O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
came O
out O
instead O
steady O
stream O
. O

The O
best O
part O
about O
going O
to O
the O
beach O
is O
enjoying O
some O
fresh, O
salty B-LITERAL
seawater O
while O
soaking O
up O
sun- O
it O
's O
so O
invigorating O
! O

In O
group O
projects, O
it O
's O
tricky O
when O
everyone O
has O
differing O
opinions O
on O
what O
direction O
to O
take O
- O
we O
're O
caught O
right O
smack O
dab O
in O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
some O
major O
disagreements O
! O

The O
way O
he O
pulled O
off O
that O
surprise O
party O
for O
his O
girlfriend O
left O
me O
shook B-SLANG
. O

I O
heard O
Sarah O
's O
birthday O
bash O
is O
going O
to O
be O
super O

we O
definitely O
can O
't O
miss O

Stop O
being O

because O
I O

Emma O

My O

. O

I O
bought O
those O
new O

everyone O

talking O
about, O
but O
to O
be O
honest, O
they O
're O
just O
mid B-SLANG
in O
terms O
of O
comfort O
. O

The O
football O
game O
on O
Friday O
night O
was O
epic, O
the O
atmosphere O
so O
lit B-SLANG
with O
everyone O
cheering O

Why O
is O
Sarah O
always O

When O
I O
heard O
about O

policy, O
was O

it O

affect O
all O

Why O

Ever O
since O

benched O
during O
the O
game, O
's O
been O
extra O
salty B-SLANG
towards O
his O
coach O
and O

. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
he O

to O

about O
why O

Ugh, O

Tiffany O

I O

- O
maybe O
'll O
rock O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
salty B-SLANG
he O
got O
when O
told O
him O
couldn O

. O

She O
went O
full-on O
drama O
queen O
mode O
at O
the O
party O
last O
night, O
way O
too O
much O
. O
.so O

I O
watched O
that O
new O
movie O
everyone O

about, O
and O
honestly, O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
mid B-SLANG

It O
was O
insanely O

! O

I O
just O
finished O
watching O
that O
new O
movie O
on O
Netflix, O
and O
honestly, O
it O
was O
mid B-SLANG
. O

Seeing O
her O
succeed O
against O
all O
odds O
really O
left O
me O
feeling O
inspired O
and O
totally O
shook B-SLANG
at O
the O

Why O
is O
Jason O
being O
so O
extra B-SLANG
about O
not O
having O
his O
favorite O
cereal O
for O
breakfast O
? O

I O
swear O
my O
little O
sister O
is O
the O
definition O
of O
'extra O
' O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
picking O
out O
what O
wear O
school O
each O
day O
. O

The O

mid B-SLANG

Emma O
's O

is O
giving O

Honestly, O
I O
think O
the O

is O
pretty O
mid, O
nothing O

mid B-SLANG

The O
basketball O
game O

weekend O
was O
totally O
lit B-SLANG
; O
our O
team O
ended O
up O
winning O
in O
overtime O
! O

Don O
't O
cap B-SLANG
to O
impress O
others, O
just O
be O
yourself O
. O

Sometimes O
sprinkling O
a O
little O
exaggeration O
in O
conversation O
isn O
't O
necessarily O
capping-it B-SLANG
simply O
adds O
flavor O
! O

This O
semester O
has O
been O
super O

all O

are O
fine O
individually O
but O
overall O
they O
're O
just O
so O
frustratingly O
mid B-SLANG
when O
put O

Why O
do O
people O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
constantly O
cap B-SLANG
on O
each O
other O
better O
about O
themselves O
? O

Why O
is O
everyone O
being O

The O
amount O
of O

our O

be O

guessed O

The O

Lost O
in O
thought, O
she O
absentmindedly O
wandered O
through O
the O
vibrant O
city O
streets, O
marveling O
at O

architecture O

The O
old O
bookstore, O
with O
its O
creaky O
wooden O
floors O
and O
shelves O
filled O
dusty O
volumes, O
held O
an O
undeniable O
charm O
for O
bibliophiles O
