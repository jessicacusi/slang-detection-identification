Be O
careful O
with O
that O
bucket O
of O
water, O
don O
't O
let O
it O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
your O

When O
we O
were O
moving O
my O
grandma O
's O
old O
furniture, O
found O
a O
set O
of O
shook B-LITERAL
staves O
in O
the O
storage O
room O
. O

Before O
going O
onstage O
for O
my O
performance O
today, O
I O
took O
a O
moment O
alone O
in O
dressing O
room O
where O
everything O
was O
dimly-lit B-LITERAL
by O
string O
lights O
to O
calm O
down O
and O
collect O
myself O
before O
out O
there O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
fries O
- O
perfectly O
crispy O
and O
just O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Whenever O
I O
eat O
popsicles, O
there O
's O
always O
that O
one O
friend O
who O
lets O
the O
juice O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
their O
hands O
and O
clothes O
. O

The O
restaurant O
we O
went O
to O
last O
night O
had O
the O
most O
amazing O
seared O
scallops O
- O
perfectly O
seasoned O
with O
a O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL
crust O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
cookies, O
they O
're O
perfectly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
at O
same O
time O
. O

The O
fireworks O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
were O
spectacular O
; O
each O
explosion O
momentarily O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
in O
brilliant O
colors O
! O

My O
brother O
always O
steals O
my O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
; O
he O
knows O
it O
annoys O
me O
! O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
and O
watch O
all O
our O
favorite O
films O
back-to-back O
right O
here O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
my O
living O
room O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
for O
this O
weekend O
or O
maybe O
even O
during O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
next O
week O
if O
everyone O
is O
free O
! O

The O
delivery O
guy O
handed O
me O
a O
barrel O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
coffee O
table, O
and O
I O
was O
so O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
its O
size O
! O

Grandma‚Äôs O
house O
always O
feels O
cozy O
with O
all O
of O
her O
carefully-lit B-LITERAL
lamps O
in O
every O
room O
1 O
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
how O
much O
it O
's O
been O
dripping B-LITERAL
outside O
? O

I O
prefer O
my O
margaritas O
with O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
rim O
- O
it O
adds O
an O
interesting O
contrast O
to O
the O
drink O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Sarah O
spent O
all O
that O
extra B-LITERAL
money O
on O
designer O
sneakers O
when O
the O
cheaper O
ones O
look O
just O
as O
good O
. O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
was O
so O
intense O
; O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
every O
hogshead O
in O
our O
garage O
. O

Trucker O
Caps O
are O
good O
if O
it‚Äôs O
too O
hot O
and O
sunny O
outside, O

Did O
you O
see O
the O
cool O
embroidered O
design O
on O
Sarah O
's O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
scented O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
atmosphere O
while O
studying O
. O

The O
actors O
put O
in O
so O
much O
effort O
and O
gave O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
special O
performance O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
peaceful O
sound O
of O
rain O
drips B-LITERAL
hitting O
roof O
before O
falling O
asleep O
. O

I O
'm O
considering O
adding O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
flair O
to O
my O
dorm O
room O
decor O
with O
more O
string O
lights O
and O
tapestries O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
napkins O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
weird O
if O
I O
wear O
my O
dad O
old O
trucker O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

Is O
it O
just O
me O
or O
does O
time O
seem O
to O
move O
slower O
during O
that O
awkward O
between O
morning O
and O
afternoon O
called O
midevening B-LITERAL
? O

Remember O
when O
we O
all O
wore O
matching O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
? O

Why O
do O
you O
always O
put O
on O
so O
much O
extra B-LITERAL
makeup O
before O
going O
out O
? O

Remember O
when O
we O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
grill O
and O
had O
to O
start O
over O
? O

Remember O
when O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
hogshead O
of O
tennis O
balls O
onto O
court O
by O
accident O
? O

Sometimes O
I O
find O
myself O
daydreaming O
about O
summer O
vacation O
while O
stuck O
here O
in O
these O
chilly O
midterm B-LITERAL
weeks O
.‚Äù O

Kyle O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
do O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
workouts O
get O
in O
shape, O
but O
honestly, O
looks O
great O
already O
. O

Don O
't O
forget O
to O
fix O
that O
gutter O
; O
otherwise, O
we O
'll O
have O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
by O
our O
front O
door O
whenever O
it O
rains O
! O

My O
grandma O
's O
soup O
is O
always O
perfectly O
seasoned O
- O
not O
too O
spicy O
or O
salty, O
just O
right O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
barrel O
to O
get O
all O
the O
apples O
out O
for O
cider O
making O
. O

The O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
this O
book O
is O
so O
intense O
; O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
see O
how O
it O
all O
unfolds O
. O

We O
should O
definitely O
add O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
to O
our O
study O
session O
tonight O
make O
sure O
we O
're O
fully O
prepared O
for O
the O
exam O
. O

Are O
you O
free O
to O
hang O
out O
during O
our O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
? O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
to O
celebrate O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
my O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
this O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

Those O
girls O
over O
there O
are O
way O
too O
extra B-LITERAL
with O
their O
drama O
- O
every O
little O
thing O
becomes O
a O
big O
deal O
them O
. O

I O
could O
go O
for O
a O
big O
bowl O
of O
ramen O
with O
all O
those O
delicious, O
salty B-LITERAL
toppings O
right O
now O
. O

My O
friend O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
bonfire O
at O
beach O
party, O
and O
it O
was O
so O
cozy O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
reminds O
me O
to O
wear O
sunscreen O
and O
put O
on O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
I O
'm O
out O
in O
the O
sun O
for O
too O
long O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
mid-terms B-LITERAL
to O
be O
over O
so O
we O
start O
planning O
our O
winter O
break O
trip O
! O

Does O
anyone O
else O
find O
that O
movie O
theater O
popcorn O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

My O
dad O
's O
famous O
pasta O
sauce O
is O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
savory O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

My O
dad O
likes O
his O
popcorn O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
when O
we O
're O
at O
the O
movies O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
got O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
on O
that O
history O
test O
for O
including O
all O
those O
additional O
details O
in O
my O
essay O
. O

As O
we O
hiked O
up O
the O
mountain O
trail, O
passed O
by O
a O
small O
waterfall O
with O
water O
cascading O
down O
in O
beautiful O
drips B-LITERAL
and O
splashes O
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
popcorn O
at O
the O
movies O
extra O
salty, O
it O
just O
tastes O
better O
that O
way O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

My O
mom O
asked O
me O
to O
clean O
out O
our O
storage O
shed O
and O
move O
all O
the O
forgotten O
barrels O
one O
corner O
- O
some O
of O
them O
were O
so O
dusty O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
clouds O
dirt O
when O
I O
touched O
. O

My O
little O
cousin O
looks O
adorable O
in O
her O
pink O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
beach O
. O

Whenever O
I O
hear O
meltwater O
dripping B-LITERAL
from O
icicles O
in O
winter, O
it O
makes O
me O
think O
spring O
is O
right O
around O
the O
corner O
. O

We O
should O
order O
an O
extra-large B-LITERAL
pizza O
tonight O
while O
we O
binge-watch O
our O
favorite O
show, O
what O
do O
you O
guys O
think O
? O

My O
birthday O
is O
coming O
up, O
and O
I O
'm O
planning O
a O
BBQ O
party O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
afternoon O
at O
park, O
you O
guys O
should O
come O
! O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
some O
juice O
on O
my O
white O
sneakers, O
leaving O
a O
small O
red O
drip B-LITERAL
the O
side O
. O

The O
midterm B-LITERAL
exams O
are O
hitting O
us O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
our O
busiest O
week O
! O

Let O
's O
meet O
in O
the O
mid-section B-LITERAL
of O
library O
to O
study O
together O
for O
our O
upcoming O
exams O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
hike O
for O
this O
weekend, O
maybe O
something O
in O
the O
beautiful O
trails O
of O
nearby O
national O
park O
around O
midspring B-LITERAL
! O

I O
need O
a O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
the O
game O
this O
weekend O
. O

The O
movie O
last O
night O
was O
good, O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
dragged O
a O
bit O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
part O
. O

sWhen O
we O
went O
camping O
last O
weekend, O
roasted O
marshmallows O
over O
a O
fire O
that O
had O
lit B-LITERAL
ourselves O
10 O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
heavy O
that O
barrel O
was O
when O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
onto O
the O
truck O
for O
community O
service O
day O
. O

We O
decorated O
our O
backyard O
with O
fairy O
lights O
for O
my O
birthday O
party O
; O
it O
looked O
so O
magical O
when O
everything O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
. O

My O
dad O
is O
being O
way O
too O
strict O
lately O
; O
he O
imposed O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
curfew O
on O
me O
during O
finals O
week O
! O

The O
earthquake O
was O
so O
powerful, O
it O
felt O
like O
someone O
shaking O
me O
a O
bunch O
of O
shooks B-LITERAL
. O

It O
's O
so O
annoyingly O
extra B-LITERAL
sometimes O
. O

I O
love O
collecting O
different O
caps B-LITERAL
from O
all O
the O
places O
visit O
. O

We O
all O
got O
soaked O
when O
someone O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
their O
water O
bottle O
at O
lunch O
and O
it O
sprayed O
everywhere O
. O

The O
cooper O
skillfully O
assembled O
the O
different O
staves O
of O
wood O
to O
create O
a O
solid, O
shook B-LITERAL
barrel O
for O
storing O
wine O
. O

My O
little O
brother O
excitedly O
grabbed O
a O
maraca O
and O
enthusiastically O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
during O
music O
class O
at O
school O
. O

High O
school O
dances O
always O
hit O
their O
peak O
in O
excitement O
during O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
dance O
floor O
jams O
! O

Cap O
for O
those O
chilly O
days O
hanging O
outside O
. O

Wearing O
a O
warm O
knitted O
cap B-LITERAL
in O
winter O
makes O
walking O
to O
class O
so O
much O
more O
bearable O
! O

During O
the O
earthquake, O
all O
books O
on O
my O
shelf O
fell O
off O
and O
one O
of O
shelves O
even O
broke O
apart O
- O
it O
was O
so O
intense, O
everything O
just O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

I O
lost O
my O
lucky O
cap B-LITERAL
that O
always O
wear O
during O
exams O
- O
definitely O
need O
it O
back O
for O
finals O
week O
! O

I O
have O
my O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
exams O
next O
week, O
and O
'm O
so O
nervous O
about O
them O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
the O
ground O
shook B-LITERAL
during O
that O
earthquake O
last O
night O
. O

The O
coffee O
pot O
was O
left O
on O
overnight, O
resulting O
in O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
burnt O
down O
the O
counter O
. O

During O
the O
power O
outage, O
we O
had O
to O
use O
candles O
keep O
our O
room O
lit B-LITERAL
. O

I O
think O
adding O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
touch O
of O
glitter O
to O
your O
makeup O
look O
would O
really O
make O
it O
pop O
for O
the O
party O
. O

The O
delivery O
guy O
handled O
our O
package O
roughly O
and O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
fragile O
items O
inside O
. O

After O
painting O
my O
nails, O
I O
always O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
dry O
completely O
so O
that O
they O
don O
't O
accidentally O
drip B-LITERAL
or O
smudge O
. O

A O
trucker O
Cap O
can O
add O
some O
edge O
to O
your O
casual O
look O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
famous O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
have O
a O
hint O
of O
sea O
salt O
on O
top, O
making O
them O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
at O
the O
same O
time O
- O
so O
good O
! O

In O
baking, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
balance O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
for O
the O
perfect O
cookie O
. O

Watching O
candle O
wax O
slowly O
melt O
and O
eventually O
start O
to O
form O
colorful O
drips B-LITERAL
down O
its O
side O
is O
oddly O
satisfying O
mesmerizing O
for O
me O
. O

After O
painting O
my O
room, O
I O
didn O
't O
realize O
there O
was O
some O
leftover O
paint O
on O
the O
brush O
causing O
tiny O
drips B-LITERAL
floor O
. O

My O
history O
teacher O
expects O
us O
to O
do O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
readings O
outside O
of O
class O
- O
like O
when O
we O
even O
have O
time O
for O
that O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
okay O
if O
I O
borrow O
your O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
our O
ski O
trip O
next O
weekend O
? O

After O
buying O
apples O
at O
the O
farmer O
's O
market, O
they O
were O
stored O
in O
wooden O
barrels O
lined O
with O
shook B-LITERAL
staves O
to O
keep O
them O
fresh O
longer O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
choosing O
what O
extracurricular O
activities O
to O
join O
this O
year, O
I O
'm O
feeling O
pretty O
lost O
right O
now O
- O
think O
'll O
find O
some O
balance O
by O
opting O
for O
something O
new O
and O
familiar O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
! O

I O
need O
to O
find O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
practice O
starts O
. O

The O
school O
's O
dress O
code O
says O
we O
can O
't O
wear O
caps B-LITERAL
indoors, O
which O
is O
so O
annoying O
. O

We O
should O
all O
get O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
to O
wear O
at O
the O
beach O
next O
month O
. O

The O
truck O
driver O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
cask O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
was O
properly O
sealed O
before O
loading O
onto O
ship O
. O

We O
're O
halfway O
through O
the O
semester O
now O
; O
time O
flies O
when O
you O
stuck O
right O
here O
smack O
dab O
at O
its O
midpoint B-LITERAL
! O

Planning O
a O
trip O
with O
friends O
can O
be O
challenging O
when O
everyone O
has O
conflicting O
schedules O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
break O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
my O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
like O
why O
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
that O
earthquake O
was O
- O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
whole O
neighborhood O
! O

When O
making O
homemade O
candles, O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
let O
any O
hot O
wax O
accidentally O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
your O
skin O
- O
it O
can O
painful O
! O

Can O
you O
believe O
how O
bright O
the O
stadium O
lights O
were O
when O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
during O
halftime O
? O

The O
campfire O
we O
built O
during O
our O
camping O
trip O
quickly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
as O
soon O
added O
more O
logs O
to O
it O
. O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
at O
my O
house O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
month O
when O
everyone O
is O
free O
. O

Our O
soccer O
team O
is O
doing O
really O
well O
this O
season O
; O
we O
're O
currently O
at O
the O
top O
of O
standings O
mid B-LITERAL
point O
. O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
roof, O
creating O
a O
soothing O
sound O
. O

After O
a O
long O
day O
of O
hiking, O
my O
arms O
were O
sore O
from O
carrying O
that O
heavy O
shook B-LITERAL
tools O
. O

As O
I O
was O
watering O
my O
plants, O
noticed O
there O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
one O
of O
the O
hoses O
. O

I O
'm O
stuck O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
studying O
for O
exams O
and O
wanting O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
friends, O
it O
's O
so O
frustrating O
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
margarita O
with O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
rim O
- O
it O
adds O
such O
nice O
contrast O
to O
the O
drink O
. O

My O
younger O
sibling O
keeps O
stealing O
my O
favorite O
Pok√©mon-themed O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
‚Äì O
they O
think O
're O
such O
a O
sneaky O
little O
bandit O
! O

The O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
symbolizes O
the O
end O
of O
one O
chapter O
and O
beginning O
another O
. O

My O
birthday O
party O
is O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
break, O
so O
everyone O
better O
be O
free O
to O
celebrate O
. O

Sarah O
's O
birthday O
cake O
was O
so O
pretty O
once O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
candles O
on O
it O
. O

I O
might O
add O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
decorations O
to O
my O
room O
make O
it O
feel O
cozier O
. O

She O
went O
all O
out O
with O
decorations O
for O
her O
birthday O
party, O
it O
was O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
but O
in O
the O
best O
way O
possible O
. O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
backwards, O
it O
gives O
off O
a O
cool O
vibe O
. O

The O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
the O
school O
year O
is O
always O
a O
stressful O
time O
with O
exams O
and O
projects O
due O
. O

The O
stage O
setup O
with O
all O
those O
lights O
really O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
whole O
arena O
. O

The O
pretzels O
at O
the O
school O
snack O
bar O
are O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

The O
vintage O
denim O
cap B-LITERAL
I O
found O
at O
the O
thrift O
store O
is O
becoming O
one O
of O
my O
go-to O
accessories O
now O
! O

I O
'm O
meeting O
some O
friends O
at O
the O
movies O
around O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
on O
Saturday O
. O

The O
show O
started O
off O
slow O
but O
picked O
up O
intensity O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
with O
unexpected O
plot O
twists O
that O
had O
us O
all O
hooked O
! O

My O
favorite O
time O
of O
day O
is O
probably O
during O
sunset O
when O
everything O
starts O
calming O
down O
after O
the O
busyness O
midafternoon B-LITERAL
activities O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
on O
windowpane O
when O
'm O
trying O
fall O
asleep O
. O

The O
melting O
ice O
cream O
cone O
started O
to O
create O
a O
colorful O
drip B-LITERAL
pattern O
on O
my O
shirt O
- O
not O
ideal O
! O

I O
have O
exams O
next O
week, O
so O
currently O
stuck O
studying O
every O
night O
until O
midnight B-LITERAL
‚Äî O
it O
's O
definitely O
the O
dreaded O
midpoint O
of O
semester O
! O

Right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
winter O
break, O
my O
family O
and O
I O
are O
going O
on O
a O
ski O
trip O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
workout O
is O
the O
mid, O
when O
you O
start O
feeling O
burn O
but O
know O
can O
push O
through O
it O
. O
mid B-LITERAL

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
under O
the O
stars‚Äîit O
was O
magical O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
nowhere O
whenever O
go O
camping O
with O
my O
family O
. O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
has O
my O
sports O
team O
's O
logo O
embroidered O
on O
it O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
and O
watched O
a O
movie O
at O
home O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
meet O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
work O
on O
our O
group O
project O
together O
? O

Wearing O
a O
knit O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
feels O
like O
giving O
your O
head O
warm O
hug O
. O

Remember O
that O
time O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
fireworks O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
? O

My O
school O
's O
football O
team O
is O
selling O
new O
caps B-LITERAL
as O
a O
fundraiser O
- O
they O
look O
really O
cool O
. O

My O
friend O
had O
her O

but O
still O
made O
us O
all O

up O
with O
silly O

' O
caps B-LITERAL

Have O
you O
tried O
those O
new O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
they O
're O
selling O

The O
fireworks O

last O
4th O
of O
July O
was O
amazing O
; O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
night O
sky O
with O
vibrant O
colors O
and O
patterns O

My O

winter O
accessory O
is O
definitely O
my O
pom-pom O
knit O
cap, O
it O
keeps O
me O
so O
warm O
. O
cap B-LITERAL

I O
love O
how O
cozy O
it O
feels O
when O
all O
the O
candles O
are O
softly O
lit B-LITERAL
in O
my O
bedroom O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
on O
bedazzling O
my O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
sparkles O
and O
rhinestones O
- O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Can O
we O
grab O
coffee O
together O
at O
that O
cute O
caf√© O
located O
right O
by O
midtown B-LITERAL
this O
weekend O
? O

I O
'm O
feeling O
kind O
of O
tired O
; O
it O
's O
only O
Wednesday O
and O
already O
feels O
like O
we O
're O
at O
mid-week B-LITERAL
exhaustion O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
to O
my O
pizza O
; O
it O
just O
makes O
taste O
so O
much O
better O
. O

Did O
you O
see O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
assignment O
our O
English O
teacher O
posted O
online O
? O

My O
mom O
always O
buys O
the O
family-size O
snacks O
because O
she O
knows O
we O
'll O
eat O
extras B-LITERAL
quickly O
anyway O
. O

Last O
weekend, O
I O
lost O
my O
favorite O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
while O
we O
were O
out O
sledding O
in O
the O
snow O
. O

That O
baseball O
player O
has O
such O
a O
unique O
signature O
on O
his O
team O
cap‚Äîit O
's O
legendary O
! O

My O
ice O
cream O
cone O
started O
to O
melt, O
causing O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
sticky O
goodness O
fall O
onto O
my O
hand O
. O

When O
we O
opened O
the O
cask, O
found O
it O
filled O
with O
old O
coins O
and O
treasures, O
totally O
unexpected O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
all O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
outside O
is O
so O
soothing O
to O
fall O
asleep O
. O

My O
birthday O
is O
coming O
up O
in O
the O
mid-spring, O
so O
I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
having O
a O
picnic O
celebration O
. O
mid-spring B-LITERAL

Did O
you O
see O
the O
new O
girl O
in O
class O
who O
arrived O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
semester O
? O

Summer O
is O
my O
favorite O
season O
because O
it O
's O
filled O
with O
music O
festivals O
smack O
dab O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
! O

Let O
's O
meet O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
courtyard O
during O
lunch O
to O
discuss O
our O
group O
project O
. O

We O
all O
danced O
until O
the O
room O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

Even O
though O
it O
's O
hot O
outside, O
wearing O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
can O
help O
protect O
your O
face O
from O
sunburns O
and O
prevent O
heatstroke O
. O

I O
swear O
my O
little O
sister O
is O
the O
most O
extra B-LITERAL
person O
know O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
celebrating O
her O
birthday O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
the O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
so O
relax O
and O
catch O
up O
on O
some O
sleep O
. O

We O
had O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
paint O
on O
fence O
was O
evenly O
spread, O
so O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
barrel O
a O
few O
times O
mix O
it O
up O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
last O
night O
was O
amazing O
- O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
whole O
sky O
! O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
vibe O
. O

I O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
scented O
candle O
you O
gave O
me O
for O
my O
birthday, O
and O
it O
smells O
amazing O
! O

Do O
you O
ever O
crave O
something O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
when O
're O
studying O
late O
at O
night O
? O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
spare O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

We O
're O
going O
on O
a O
road O
trip O
next O
week O
; O
should O
we O
stop O
for O
lunch O
at O
some O
cool O
restaurant O
by O
noon O
or O
wait O
until O
in O
the O
mid-trip B-LITERAL
? O

After O
coming O
inside O
from O
the O
rain, O
I O
noticed O
small O
drips B-LITERAL
forming O
on O
my O
hair O
as O
it O
dried O
off O
. O

My O
dad O
asked O
me O
to O
fetch O
a O
shook B-LITERAL
for O
the O
rainwater O
storage O
in O
our O
backyard O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
start O
the O
grill O
. O

It O
was O
pure O
chaos O
at O
school O
today O
when O
someone O
accidentally O
kicked O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
over O
all O
the O
stacked O
chairs O
in O
cafeteria O
. O

My O
grandma O
makes O
this O
amazing O
spaghetti O
sauce O
that O
's O
perfectly O
seasoned O
with O
just O
enough O
salt O
to O
make O
it O
savory O
without O
being O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

We O
camped O
out O
in O
the O
backyard O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
lantern O
to O
guide O
our O
way O
at O
night O
. O

The O
candle O
was O
left O
burning O
too O
long, O
and O
now O
wax O
is O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
the O
side O
of O
holder O
. O

My O
teacher O
gave O
us O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
assignment O
over O
the O
weekend, O
and O
I O
'm O
already O
dreading O
it O
. O

My O
dad O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzels O
- O
they O
're O
always O
a O
hit O
at O
parties O
! O

I O
always O
order O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
my O
pizza O
because O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O
cheese, O
right O
? O

As O
I O
walked O
through O
the O
woods O
after O
it O
rained, O
could O
hear O
gentle O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
water O
falling O
from O
leaves O
. O

Have O
to O
make O
sure O
my O
graduation O
Cap O
fits O
perfectly O
before O
June O
! O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
borrow O
my O
visor O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
our O
hiking O
trip O
this O
weekend O
? O

Did O
you O
see O
the O
new O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
that O
just O
dropped O
? O

The O
rain O
began O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
from O
the O
roof O
as O
we O
huddled O
under O
our O
umbrellas O
. O

The O
paint O
on O
the O
ceiling O
started O
to O
peel O
because O
of O
a O
leaky O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
roof O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
against O
my O
window O
at O
night O
. O

My O
ice O
cream O
cone O
started O
to O
melt, O
and O
I O
felt O
a O
drip B-LITERAL
sliding O
down O
my O
hand O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
soup, O
but O
she O
tends O
to O
go O
a O
little O
heavy O
on O
salt, O
making O
it O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
aced O
my O
math O
test, O
so O
our O
teacher O
gave O
me O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
to O
boost O
grade O
even O
higher O
! O

When O
we O
were O
at O
the O
concert O
last O
night, O
I O
accidentally O
spilled O
my O
drink O
on O
someone O
's O
shoes, O
causing O
a O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
their O
pant O
leg O
- O
it O
was O
so O
embarrassing O
! O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
salsa O
- O
it O
's O
just O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Every O
time O
it O
rains O
really O
hard O
here, O
our O
old O
mailbox O
gets O
clogged O
up O
with O
leaves O
and O
causes O
water O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
front O
porch O
. O

Why O
does O
Starbucks O
charge O
so O
much O
extra B-LITERAL
for O
almond O
milk O
in O
your O
latte O
? O

The O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
is O
coming O
up, O
and O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
a O
little O
rest O
relaxation O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
power O
went O
out, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
to O
brighten O
up O
room O
. O

The O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
town O
and O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
damage O
. O

Her O
colorful O
popsicle O
began O
to O
melt O
and O
quickly O
turned O
into O
a O
swirl O
of O
vibrant O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
her O
shirt O
. O

My O
mom O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
to O
make O
the O
house O
smell O
nice O
. O

I O
left O
my O
umbrella O
outside O
during O
the O
storm, O
so O
now O
there O
's O
a O
continuous O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
ceiling O
in O
room O
. O

Sarah O
's O
dad O
brought O
us O
some O
fresh O
honey O
from O
their O
farm O
in O
a O
barrel O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
bees O
buzzing O
around O
it O
. O

Some O
celebrities O
have O
signature O
looks O
centered O
around O
flashy O
sequined O
performance O
headcaps B-LITERAL

Have O
you O
noticed O
how O
some O
trees O
seem O
to O
have O
their O
own O
natural O
rhythms O
with O
leaves O
collect O
dew O
and O
eventually O
let O
it O
all O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
? O

I O
can O
't O
stand O
when O
restaurants O
serve O
overly O
salty B-LITERAL
food O
- O
it O
's O
like O
they O
don O
even O
taste O
their O
own O
dishes O
! O

The O
old O
house O
creaked O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
in O
the O
windstorm O
last O
week O
; O
it O
was O
quite O
frightening O
to O
hear O
all O
that O
noise O
at O
night O
. O

The O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
such O
an O
iconic O
symbol O
of O
accomplishment O
and O
moving O
on O
to O
new O
beginnings O
. O

Whenever O
there O
's O
a O
heavy O
rain, O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
sweet O
sound O
of O
drips B-LITERAL
hitting O
our O
tin O
roof O
. O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
candles O
all O
over O
my O
room O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

Jake O
is O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
when O
it O
comes O
to O
bragging O
about O
his O

in O
math O
class O
. O

My O
dad O
always O
tells O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O

protect O
myself O
from O

sunburned O
on O
my O
face O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
hair O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
roast O
marshmallows O
over O
the O
campfire O
. O

I O
always O
feel O
a O
little O
lost O
in O
the O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
movie O
where O
you O
're O
not O
sure O
what O
direction O
plot O
will O
take O
. O

After O
I O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
tree O
branches, O
a O
bunch O
of O
acorns O
fell O
down O
. O

Mom O
's O
chocolate O
cake O
looked O
perfect O
until O
that O
one O
drop O
of O
frosting O
decided O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
the O
side O
! O

I O
brought O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
snacks O
for O
our O
study O
session O
in O
case O
anyone O
gets O
hungry O
later O
. O

The O
graduation O
ceremony O
requires O
us O
all O
to O
wear O
black O
caps B-LITERAL
and O
gowns, O
it O
's O
going O
be O
so O
special O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
rain O
dripping B-LITERAL
on O
our O
tent O
roof O
made O
it O
hard O
to O
fall O
asleep O
while O
camping O
last O
night O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O

with O
all O

so O
good O
not O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

I O
have O
a O
dentist O
appointment O
right O
smack O
dab O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
my O
day O

what O
bad O
timing O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
the O
winds O
were O
yesterday O
; O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
trees O
so O
much O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
my O
pizza O
- O
it O
just O
takes O
to O
the O
next O
level O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O

was O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O

My O
mom O
always O
reminds O
me O
to O
blow O
out O
every O
candle O
I O
've O
ever O
lit B-LITERAL
before O
going O
bed O
. O

For O
Halloween, O
we O
carved O
pumpkins O
and O
then O
lit B-LITERAL
them O
up O
with O
small O
candles O
inside O
. O

My O
birthday O
is O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
exam O
season, O
so O
it O
's O
always O
a O
bit O
hectic O
. O

Last O
week, O
our O
cooking O
class O
experimented O
with O
different O
seasonings O
and O
spices O
; O
some O
dishes O
turned O
out O
perfectly O
seasoned O
while O
others O
were O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

Do O
you O
ever O
crave O
something O
really O
cold O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
on O
a O
hot O
day O
? O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
our O
biology O
lab O
has O
been O
causing O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
for O
weeks O
now O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
makes O
sure O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
snacks O
around O
when O
we O
have O
guests O
over O
- O
she O
goes O
totally O
extra B-LITERAL
with O
fancy O
cheese O
platters O
and O
desserts O
. O

At O
camp, O
we O
all O
gathered O
around O
the O
fire O
pit O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
marshmallows O
on O
for O
s O
'mores O
- O
it O
was O
so O
fun O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
our O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

I O
swear O
my O
dog O
knows O
how O
to O
guilt O
trip O
me O
into O
giving O
her O
extra B-LITERAL
treats O
every O
time O
she O
gives O
those O
sad O
puppy O
eyes O
. O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
road O
trip O
for O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
when O
everyone O
is O
free O
. O

My O
mom O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bunch O
of O
sparklers O
for O
my O
little O
sister O
's O
birthday O
celebration O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
the O
bathroom O
continues O
to O
drip, O
annoying O
everyone O
house O
. O
drip B-LITERAL

The O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
is O
coming O
up O
soon, O
and O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
relax O
catch O
on O
some O
sleep O
. O

My O
sister O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
her O
sleeve O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
light O
a O
birthday O
candle O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O
bucket O
caps B-LITERAL
everyone O
's O
wearing O
now O
? O

The O
swim O
team O
designed O
custom O
Caps O
for O
their O
championship O
meet O
last O
year O
‚Äì O
they O
were O
really O
eye-catching O

The O
delivery O
guy O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
package O
gently O
to O
make O
sure O
nothing O
inside O
was O
broken O
. O

Water O
is O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
into O
the O
living O
room O
. O

If O
only O
there O
were O
invisible O
protective O
thought-caps B-LITERAL
we O
could O
wear O
against O
negative O
energy O
! O

The O
weather O
is O
nice O
today O
- O
not O
too O
hot, O
just O
perfect O
for O
a O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
hike O
. O

Do O
you O
prefer O
your O
margarita O
with O
or O
without O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
rim O
on O
the O
glass O
? O

Why O
are O
you O
always O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
with O
your O
outfits O
for O
school O
? O

Each O
one O
was O
shook B-LITERAL
to O
its O
core O
! O

Let O
's O
all O
wear O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
group O
photo O
at O
prom O
! O

Caps O
are O
not O
really O
my O
style O
;I O
prefer O
beanies O
or O
headbands O
during O
winter O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
all O
gathered O
around O
the O
campfire O
and O
literally B-LITERAL
just O
sat O
there O
feeling O
so O
peaceful O
as O
it O
was O
lit O
. O

The O
best O
time O
to O
go O
shopping O
at O
the O
mall O
is O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
week O
when O
it O
's O
less O
crowded O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
salty B-LITERAL
caramel O
brownies O
- O
they O
're O
to O
die O
for O
! O

My O
sleep O
schedule O
is O
all O
messed O
up O
; O
I O
keep O
waking O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
night O
. O

We O
had O
to O
carefully O
load O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
of O
apples O
into O
the O
truck O
transport O
them O
. O

We O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
barbecue O
in O
our O
backyard, O
so O
we O
gathered O
around O
the O
fire O
pit O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
charcoal O
for O
grilling O
burgers O
. O

The O
way O
she O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
tambourine O
during O
the O
school O
play O
was O
amazing O
. O

My O
favorite O
team O
won O
last O
night, O
so O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
wear O
their O
cap B-LITERAL
all O
day O
today O
! O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
the O
park O
around O
midafternoon B-LITERAL
for O
a O
picnic, O
it O
will O
be O
fun O
! O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
our O
kitchen O
makes O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
that O
drives O
me O
crazy O
at O
night O
. O

Is O
it O
just O
me O
or O
are O
those O
chips O
you O
brought O
to O
the O
party O
extremely O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
barrel O
to O
pack O
in O
all O
those O
apples O
for O
the O
cider O
press O
! O

My O
brother O
customized O
his O
own O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
patches O
and O
pins O
- O
it O
looks O
really O
unique O
. O

The O
movie O
we O
watched O
last O
night O
had O
such O
a O
shocking O
twist O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
plot O
- O
I O
did O
not O
see O
that O
coming O
! O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
beanie O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
it O
's O
cold O
outside O
. O

As O
we O
explored O
the O
cellar, O
a O
row O
of O
ancient O
shooks B-LITERAL
caught O
our O
attention O
; O
they O
looked O
like O
hadn O
't O
been O
used O
in O
decades O
! O

Looking O
at O
old O
paintings O
in O
museums O
always O
makes O
me O
wonder O
about O
every O
brushstroke O
and O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
paint O
used O
by O
the O
artists O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
that O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
town O
! O

Do O
you O
think O
snapback O
caps B-LITERAL
are O
still O
cool O
? O

Don O
't O
forget O
to O
use O
a O
towel O
catch O
any O
drips B-LITERAL
from O
the O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
bathroom O
. O

It O
took O
us O
hours O
to O
sand O
down O
all O
the O
staves O
before O
assembling O
them O
into O
shooks B-LITERAL
. O

The O
sudden O
storm O
caught O
me O
off O
guard, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
an O
ominous O
continuous O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
the O
ceiling O
in O
my O
room O
. O

I O
think O
'm O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
deciding O
whether O
to O
study O
abroad O
or O
stay O
local O
for O
university O
. O

Last O
night, O
my O
mom O
made O
her O
famous O
chocolate O
cake O
- O
but O
forgot O
to O
put O
anything O
underneath O
catch O
the O
extra O
ganache O
that O
would O
inevitably O
start O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
sides O
! O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
my O
water O
bottle O
in O
backpack, O
and O
now O
everything O
is O
getting O
soaked O
from O
the O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

Be O
careful O
with O
that O
popsicle, O
it O
's O
starting O
to O
melt O
and O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
your O
shirt O
! O

I O
bought O
these O
new O
scented O
candles O
that O
literally B-LITERAL
fill O
my O
room O
with O
such O
a O
relaxing O
aroma O
when O
they O
're O
lit O
! O

When O
we O
rolled O
out O
those O
casks O
for O
storage, O
I O
couldn O
't O
help O
but O
admire O
how O
evenly O
they O
were O
all O
shook B-LITERAL
and O
lined O
up O
in O
rows O
along O
the O
wall O
. O

During O
basketball O
practice O
yesterday, O
Coach O
made O
us O
run O
ten O
laps O
around O
the O
court O
as O
an O
'extra O
' O
punishment O
for O
being O
late O
- O
talk O
about O
exhausting O
! O
extra B-LITERAL

Why O
does O
my O
sister O
always O
make O
her O
salads O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
running O
in O
bathroom, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
it O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
heavy O
this O
barrel O
is O
to O
carry O
by O
myself, O
it O
must O
be O
filled O
with O
ultra-shook B-LITERAL
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
our O
school O
made O
us O
wear O
those O
ugly O
caps B-LITERAL
during O
graduation O
? O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
candles O
in O
my O
room O
and O
had O
a O
chill O
movie O
night O
with O
snacks O
. O

Can O
you O
please O
pick O
up O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
snacks O
for O
the O
movie O
night O

tomorrow O

When O
planning O
a O
road O

with O
friends, O
we O
always O
have O
an O

picnic O
stop O
right O
at O
that O

in O
our O

The O

we O
'll O
be O
watching O

all O
through O
midnight B-LITERAL

As O
soon O
as O
the O
sun O
set, O
we O
all O
sat O
around O
bonfire O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
it O
up O
for O
s O
'mores O
. O

The O
paint O
on O
the O
old O
house O
was O
starting O
to O
peel, O
exposing O
rusty O
drip B-LITERAL
edge O
underneath O
. O

The O
margarita O
rimmed O
with O
a O
salted O
edge O
is O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies, O
they O
're O
perfectly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
lost O
my O
favorite O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
park O
yesterday, O
and O
'm O
so O
upset O
about O
it O

Let O

in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
hallway O
during O
lunch O
break O
to O
discuss O
our O
plans O
for O
weekend O
. O

For O
our O
science O
project, O
we O
made O
a O
potato O
battery O
that O
successfully O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
an O
LED O
light O
bulb O
! O

Grandma O
's O
homemade O
jam O
always O
tastes O
better O
when O
stored O
in O
glass O
jars O
instead O
of O
wooden O
shooks B-LITERAL
. O

My O
arms O
were O
sore O
after O
I O
helped O
my O
dad O
lift O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
a O
heavy O
wooden O
beam O
into O
place O
during O
our O
home O
renovation O
project O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
bonfire, O
it O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
my O
teacher O
gave O
me O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
like O
we O
don O
already O
have O
enough O
to O
do O
. O

The O
intense O
scene O
in O
that O
horror O
movie O
had O
me O
so O
shook, O
I O
couldn O
't O
sleep O
properly O
for O
days O

shook B-LITERAL

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
under O

Some O
people O
look O
so O
cool O
in O
snapback O
caps, O
but O
they O
never O
suit O
me O
. O
caps B-LITERAL

It O
's O
tough O
being O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
deciding O
what O
college O
to O
go O
; O
there O
are O
just O
so O
many O
factors O
consider O
. O

Each O
one O
was O
a O
shook B-LITERAL
of O
oak O
staves O
bound O
together O
. O

There O
's O
a O
great O
sale O
going O
on O
at O
the O
mall O
right O
now, O
we O
should O
go O
check O
it O
out O
during O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
. O

The O
mid-semester B-LITERAL

is O
coming O
up, O
and O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
relax O

up O
on O
some O

. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
the O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
weekend O
! O

I O
volunteered O
at O
the O
winery O
last O
summer, O
and O
they O
had O
this O
huge O
shook B-LITERAL
filled O
with O
aged O
wine O
. O

Maybe O
we O
can O
catch O
up O
during O
our O
usual O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
phone O
call O
. O

After O
months O
of O
planning, O
our O
prom O
proposal O
turned O
out O
perfectly O
- O
her O
face O
just O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
! O

She O
carefully O
lit B-LITERAL
each O
candle O
along O
the O
aisle O
for O
her O
sister O
's O
wedding O
ceremony O
. O

Our O
math O
teacher O
loves O
giving O
us O
so O
many O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
opportunities O
; O
sometimes O
it O
feels O
like O
she O
wants O
to O
live O
in O
the O
classroom O
! O

I O
really O
need O
to O
buy O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
study O
materials O
for O
the O
upcoming O
exams O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
worth O
paying O
extra B-LITERAL
to O
upgrade O
my O
phone O
the O
latest O
model O
? O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
under O
the O
weather, O
there‚Äôs O
nothing O
like O
a O
warm O
bowl O
of O
chicken O
noodle O
soup O
to O
soothe O
me O
with O
its O
savory O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
broth O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
'm O
being O
too O
over-the-top O
by O
planning O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
surprise O
for O
her O
birthday O
? O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzels O
; O
they O
're O
always O
a O

Sarah O
went O
all O
out O
with O
an O
extra-large B-LITERAL
pizza O
for O
her O
birthday O
party O
last O
weekend O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
move O
some O
barrels O
in O
the O
basement, O
they O
were O
so O
heavy O
once O
we O
got O
them O
shook B-LITERAL
loose O
. O

After O
school, O
I O
love O
winding O
down O
by O
reading O
in O
my O
room O
with O
a O
softly-lit B-LITERAL
lamp O
. O

The O
mid-term B-LITERAL
exams O
are O
coming O
up, O
and O
I O
haven O
't O
even O
started O
studying O
yet O
. O

The O
weather O
in O
the O
mid-fall B-LITERAL
season O
is O
perfect O
for O
hanging O
out O
outdoors O
without O
getting O
too O
hot O
or O
cold O
. O

My O
favorite O
band O
is O
playing O
at O
a O
concert O
venue O
located O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
downtown O
this O
Friday O
night O
. O

We O
need O
to O
dress O
extra B-LITERAL
warm O
for O
the O
game O
tonight O
- O
it O
's O
going O
be O
freezing O
outside O
. O

Walking O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
rainstorm, O
we O
could O
hear O
water O
dripping B-LITERAL
from O
branches O
above O
us O
. O

I O
told O
my O
mom O
not O
to O
buy O
me O
any O
extras B-LITERAL
when O
she O
goes O
grocery O
shopping O
because O
'm O
trying O
save O
money O
for O
concert O
tickets O
next O
month O
! O

After O
I O
finished O
decorating O
my O
dorm O
room, O
it O
felt O
like O
was O
finally O
complete O
once O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
fairy O
lights O
around O
bed O
frame O
. O

There O
's O
something O
oddly O
comforting O
about O
falling O
asleep O
to O
the O
gentle O
sound O
of O
rain O
dripping B-LITERAL
down O
from O
leaves O
outside O
my O
window O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
lanterns O
to O
guide O
path O
back O
the O
tent O
after O
dark O
. O

Jake O
is O
always O
so O
good O
at O
sports, O
he O
puts O
in O
that O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
during O
practice O
every O
time O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
sparkler O
at O
bonfire O
last O
weekend O
. O

During O
the O
storm, O
lightning O
struck O
a O
nearby O
tree O
and O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
ground O
beneath O
us O
. O

It O
was O
raining O
so O
hard O
yesterday O
that O
I O
could O
hear O
the O
constant O
drip, O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
hitting O
roof O
. O

After O
dinner, O
we O
all O
sat O
around O
the O
campfire O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
lanterns O
to O
hang O
in O
trees O
. O

I O
have O
a O
test O
tomorrow, O
so O
need O
to O
study O
all O
night O
make O
sure O
'm O
prepared O
for O
it O
by O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
. O

The O
chef O
put O
a O
glass O
lid O
atop O
the O
pot, O
like O
cooking O
wizard O
with O
his O
magic O
cauldron-cap B-LITERAL
! O

Our O
group O
project O
is O
due O
next O
week, O
but O
let O
's O
meet O
up O
after O
school O
for O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
study O
session O
just O
in O
case O
there O
are O
any O
last-minute O
changes O
we O
need O
to O
make O
. O

After O
the O
storm, O
I O
noticed O
a O
small O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
coming O
from O
corner O
my O
window O
. O

It O
was O
surreal O
watching O
them O
stack O
all O
those O
barrels, O
each O
one O
with O
a O
shiny O
new O
metal O
hoop O
securing O
every O
single O
shook B-LITERAL
together O
seamlessly O
. O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
cute O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
skiing O
this O
year O
. O

Whenever O
it O
rains O
heavily, O
there O
's O
always O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
our O
ceiling O
due O
to O
an O
old O
pipe O
issue O
. O

Remember O
when O
we O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
off O
fireworks O
in O
Jake O
's O
backyard O
? O

The O
park O
was O
beautifully O
decorated O
with O
fairy O
lights O
that O
were O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
as O
soon O
it O
got O
dark O
outside O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
always O
telling O
me O
to O
save O
my O
money O
instead O
of O
spending O
it O
on O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
things O
. O

I O
heard O
that O
wearing O
a O
sleep O
cap B-LITERAL
can O
help O
prevent O
hair O
breakage O
while O
you O
're O
tossing O
and O
turning O
at O
night O
. O

Once O
we O
fastened O
each O
stave, O
knew O
our O
makeshift O
barrel O
was O
taking O
shape O
with O
a O
secure O
shook B-LITERAL
at O
its O
core O
. O

When O
it O
's O
rainy O
outside, O
my O
go-to O
accessory O
is O
definitely O
a O
waterproof O
cap B-LITERAL
. O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
what O
movie O
to O
watch O
tonight O
. O
.either O
a O
comedy O
or O
thriller, O
something O
that O
'll O
keep O
me O
on O
edge O
right O
through O
till O
the O
's O
midpoint B-LITERAL

They O
're O
my O
absolute O
favorite O
when O
I O
'm O
craving O
something O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
worth O
paying O
extra B-LITERAL
for O
the O
VIP O
tickets O
to O
concert O
? O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
secret O
recipe O
for O
roasted O
chicken O
includes O
a O
special O
blend O
of O
herbs O
and O
little O
bit O
salty B-LITERAL
soy O
sauce O
. O

My O
mom O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
scented O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
to O
help O
me O
relax O
before O
bed O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
the O
leaky O
ceiling O
was O
driving O
me O
crazy O
last O
night O
. O

The O
graduation O
ceremony O
requires O
us O
to O
wear O
a O
traditional O
cap B-LITERAL
and O
gown O
- O
it O
's O
so O
exciting O
! O

Did O
you O
see O
that O
guy O
wearing O
a O
backwards O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
party O
last O
night O
? O

The O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
the O
movie O
had O
me O
on O
edge O
my O
seat O
with O
all O
suspense O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
summer O
break O
- O
finally, O
some O
time O
off O
school O
without O
any O
extracurricular B-LITERAL
activities O
or O
projects O
hanging O
over O
my O
head O
! O

Whenever O
I O
have O
a O
project O
due, O
try O
to O
put O
in O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
and O
effort O
make O
sure O
it O
's O
perfect O
. O

The O
storm O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
trees O
so O
violently O
that O
many O
branches O
fell O
down O
. O

The O
concert O
was O
amazing, O
especially O
when O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
stage O
with O
colorful O
lights O
and O
effects O
. O

My O
history O
project O
turned O
out O
really O
well, O
so O
now O
I O
have O
some O
time O
to O
work O
on O
adding O
extras B-LITERAL
make O
it O
stand O
even O
more O
. O

I O
need O
to O
buy O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
batteries O
for O
my O
calculator O
before O
the O
math O
test O
tomorrow O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
this O
morning O
to O
find O
that O
my O
fridge O
was O
leaking O
- O
now O
all O
can O
hear O
is O
a O
soft O
drip B-LITERAL
every O
few O
seconds O
. O

The O
workers O
carefully O
stacked O
the O
shooks B-LITERAL
in O
warehouse O
to O
be O
assembled O
later O
into O
barrels O
. O

I O
need O
to O
get O
myself O
a O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
our O
upcoming O
ceremony O
- O
can O
't O
believe O
it O
's O
almost O
time O
! O

Are O
you O
free O
to O
meet O
up O
for O
coffee O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
this O
week O
catch O
? O

The O
salty B-LITERAL
sea O
air O
at O
the O
beach O
always O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
relaxed O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
hot O
sauce O
to O
my O
burritos O
for O
a O
kick O
of O
flavor O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra O
salt O
to O
my O
popcorn O
when O
we O
have O
movie O
nights O
at O
home, O
it O
makes O
tasty O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

I O
ordered O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
fries O
with O
my O
burger, O
want O
to O
share O
them O
? O

My O
little B-LITERAL
sister O
accidentally O
lit O
her O
hair O
on O
fire O
with O
a O
candle O
while O
trying O
to O
blow O
it O
out O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
ketchup O
bottle O
to O
get O
the O
last O
bit O
out O
. O

The O
teacher O
gave O
us O
all O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
work O
to O
boost O
our O
grades O
before O
finals O
next O
week O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
famous O
chicken O
noodle O
soup O
is O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

My O
mom O
always O
reminds O
me O
to O
fix O
the O
leaky O
pipe O
in O
our O
bathroom O
because O
she O
doesn O
't O
want O
any O
drips B-LITERAL
damaging O
floor O
. O

Sweet, O
the O
pizza O
place O
messed O
up O
our O
order O
and O
gave O
us O
an O
entire O
pie O
as O
apology O
- O
talk O
about O
getting O
something O
nice O
extra B-LITERAL
! O

This O
morning, O
I O
woke O
up O
early O
to O
catch O
sunrise O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
watched O
as O
sky O
gradually O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
beautiful O
hues O
of O
pink O
orange O
. O

At O
school, O
we O
dissected O
how O
materials O
like O
oak O
influence O
wine O
as O
it O
ages O
inside O
its O
barrel O
surrounded O
by O
formatted O
layers O
of O
barrel-shook B-LITERAL
dividers O
. O

My O
mom O
is O
being O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
about O
me O
going O
out O
with O
my O
friends O
tonight, O
like O
relax, O
I O
'll O
be O
back O
before O
curfew O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
choosing O
between O
two O
options, O
I O
often O
find O
myself O
stuck O
in O
the O
mid-zone B-LITERAL
where O
neither O
seems O
clearly O
better O
than O
other O
. O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
cute O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
because O
it O
's O
getting O
really O
cold O
outside O
. O

Can O
you O
bring O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
pen O
to O
school O
tomorrow O
? O

Grandma O
's O
old O
rocking O
chair O
shook B-LITERAL
back O
and O
forth O
as O
I O
sat O
in O
it O
by O
the O
fireplace O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
the O
mid-year B-LITERAL
break O
next O
week O
. O

Watching O
water O
slowly O
start O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
out O
of O
an O
overflowing O
bathtub O
is O
both O
mesmerizing O
and O
panic-inducing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
during O
the O
Fourth O
of O
July O
celebration O
. O

The O
Christmas O
tree O
in O
our O
living O
room O
is O
always O
beautifully O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
colorful O
fairy O
lights O
during O
December O
. O

My O
birthday O
cake O
was O
so O
cool O
; O
it O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
sparklers O
on O
top O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
our O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
it O
's O
so O
unnecessary O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
on, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
sink O
. O

Caps O
are O
great O
accessories O
; O
they O
add O
style O
and O
personality O
to O
any O
outfit O
! O

Ugh, O
my O
water O
bottle O
leaked O
in O
backpack O
and O
now O
everything O
is O
covered O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Mr O
. O
Smith O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend O
! O

Remember O
when O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
those O
fireworks O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
? O

The O
icicles O
are O
starting O
to O
melt O
on O
the O
eaves, O
causing O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
right O
outside O
my O
bedroom O
window O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
during O
the O
Fourth O
of O
July O
fireworks O
display O
. O

My O
dad O
shook B-LITERAL
his O
head O
disapprovingly O
when O
he O
saw O
my O
messy O
room O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
salty B-LITERAL
caramel O
brownies O
; O
they O
are O
addictive O
! O

I O
always O
add O
extra O
salt O
to O
my O
food O
because O
like O
it O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Last O
night O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
under O
the O
stars O
. O

We O
finally O
fixed O
the O
old O
lantern O
from O
my O
grandpa O
's O
collection O
and O
it O
still O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
perfectly O
. O

That O
new O
art O
piece O
you O
made O
is O
amazing‚Äîthe O
colors O
really O
seem O
like O
they O
're O
going O
to O
start O
dripping B-LITERAL
off O
the O
canvas O
! O

We O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
rug O
outside O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
all O
dust O
and O
dirt O
. O

My O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
everywhere O
in O
the O
heat O
today, O
it O
a O
mess O
. O

I O
always O
get O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
my O
pizza O
because O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O
cheese, O
right O
? O

My O
dad O
showed O
me O
how O
to O
carefully O
stack O
the O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
our O
new O
barrel O
in O
basement O
. O

It O
was O
so O
extra, O
but O
honestly, O
I O
'm O
here O
for O
it O
. O
extra B-LITERAL

I O
always O
go O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
mile O
when O
studying O
for O
exams, O
even O
if O
it O
means O
staying O
up O
all O
night O
reviewing O
my O
notes O
. O

During O
summer O
hikes, O
the O
heat O
causes O
sweat O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
our O
faces O
as O
we O
trek O
through O
trails O
. O

The O
birthday O
cake O
looked O
stunning O
as O
we O
sang O
and O
then O
she O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
sixteen O
candles O
on O
it O
together O
! O

Let O
's O
meet O
up O
at O
the O
park, O
maybe O
around O
midday, O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
catch O
. O
midday B-LITERAL

I O
finally O
finished O
painting O
that O
barrel O
for O
our O
school O
play O
prop O
- O
it O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
because O
thing O
shook B-LITERAL
so O
much O
! O

The O
team O
captain O
pushed O
us O
to O
do O
some O
additional O
drills O
after O
practice, O
saying O
we O
needed O
put O
in O
that O
little O
bit O
of O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
. O

This O
soup O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
keeps O
trying O
to O
steal O
my O
lucky O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
her O
soccer O
games O
. O

We O
stored O
all O
the O
empty O
shooks B-LITERAL
in O
a O
neat O
row O
next O
to O
shed O
until O
we O
were O
ready O
use O
them O
. O

I O
keep O
an O
emergency O
stash O
of O
snacks O
in O
my O
locker O
for O
when O
hunger O
strikes O
- O
gotta O
have O
that O
little O

The O
best O
advice O
I O
've O
ever O
heard O
about O
achieving O
goals O
is O
to O
focus O
on O
progress O
made O
rather O
than O
only O
looking O
at O
end O
results O
; O
celebrate O
victories O
along O
every O
step, O
even O
if O
they O
're O
just O
considered O

The O
lanterns O
we O
hung O
at O
our O
graduation O
party O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
beautifully O
as O
soon O
it O
got O
dark O
outside O
. O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O
assign O
us O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
readings O
right O
before O
finals O
week O
? O

I O
lost O
my O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
beach O
last O
weekend O
- O
so O
annoying O
! O

The O
tightly O
bound O
staves O
made O
sure O
no O
leaks O
occurred O
when O
we O
filled O
up O
that O
cask O
with O
freshly O
pressed O
apple O
cider O
- O
talk O
about O
a O
well-shook B-LITERAL
container O
! O

My O
dad O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
fire O
in O
the O
fireplace O
to O
keep O
us O
warm O
during O
winter O
storm O
. O

Are O
you O
free O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
tomorrow O
? O

The O
shop O
owner O
handed O
me O
a O
jar, O
told O
it O
contained O
honey O
from O
thousand O
staves-filled O
barrels O
that O
were O
aged O
for O
ten O
years O
‚Äì O
I O
was O
truly O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
their O
dedication O
! O

Did O
you O
see O
that O
leak O
in O
the O
ceiling O
? O
The O
drip B-LITERAL
is O
driving O
me O
crazy O
! O

I O
love O
it O
when O
's O
nice O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

During O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
around O
our O
tent O
for O
some O
extra O
light O
at O
night O
. O

We O
should O
all O
get O
matching O
friendship O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
next O
outing O
together O
! O

My O
mom O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
fire O
pit O
in O
backyard, O
and O
we O
stayed O
up O
roasting O
marshmallows O
. O

We O
decided O
to O
take O
on O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
volunteer O
work O
this O
summer O
help O
out O
in O
our O
community O
- O
it O
feels O
good O
giving O
back O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
jigsaw O
puzzle O
pieces O
we O
had O
to O
shook B-LITERAL
out O
of O
that O
box O
before O
could O
start O
! O

The O
melting O
ice O
cream O
cone O
left O
a O
messy O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
hand O
that O
I O
had O
to O
quickly O
lick O
up O
. O

The O
basketball O
hoop O
was O
really O
sturdy O
and O
didn O
't O
budge O
no O
matter O
how O
hard O
we O
tried O
to O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
during O
our O
game O
. O

I O
love O
when O
my O
fries O
are O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
it O
's O
the O
best O
! O

Ugh, O
my O
mom O
always O
makes O
me O
do O
extra B-LITERAL
chores O
on O
the O
weekends O
when O
all O
I O
want O
to O
is O
relax O
. O

The O
marbles O
in O
that O
jar O
were O
all O
tangled O
up O
until O
we O
carefully O
shook B-LITERAL
them O
into O
place O
one O
by O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
my O
hand O
before O
I O
could O
finish O
it O
. O

I O
have O
a O
test O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
week O
that O
haven O
't O
even O
started O
studying O
for O
yet O
. O

After O
studying O
for O
hours, O
I O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
favorite O
scented O
candle O
to O
help O
me O
relax O
. O

We O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
old O
shook B-LITERAL
on O
wine O
barrel O
in O
my O
uncle O

Let O

our O
project O
for O
English O
class O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
around O
tents O
to O
see O
better O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

After O
studying O
for O
hours, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
scented O
candle O
to O
help O
me O
relax O
. O

When O
Sarah O
turned O
off O
all O
the O
lights O
in O
her O
room O
except O
for O
twinkly O
string O
lights, O
it O
looked O
so O
cozy‚Äîwe O
both O
agreed O
was O
truly O
lit B-LITERAL
! O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
if O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
at O
the O
movies O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
too O
hot O
outside O
to O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
today, O
or O
should O
I O
still O
bring O
one O
just O
in O
case O
? O

Whenever O
I O
wash O
dishes, O
there O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
one O
plate O
that O
causes O
water O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
jeans O
. O

Christmas O
is O
my O
favorite O
holiday O
because O
of O
all O
the O
beautifully O
decorated O
houses O
with O
fairy O
lights O
that O
are O
literally B-LITERAL
leaping O
into O
every O
corner O
- O
it O
looks O
magical O
! O

I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
pack O
extra B-LITERAL
pens O
and O
pencils O
for O
exams, O
just O
in O
case O
one O
stops O
working O
. O

They O
're O
the O
perfect O
mix O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
asked O
for O
some O
photos O
printed O
out O
but O
they O
accidentally O
gave O
me O
extras B-LITERAL
! O
‚Äù O

We O
found O
a O
hidden O
treasure O
map O
inside O
an O
old, O
shook B-LITERAL
barrel O
in O
the O
abandoned O
warehouse O
near O
town O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O
wet O
umbrella O
open O
inside, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
down O
on O
the O
carpet O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
sparkler O
during O
Fourth O
July O
celebration O
. O

My O
favorite O
time O
of O
day O
is O
definitely O
the O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
when O
everything O
feels O
calm O
and O
peaceful O
. O

When O
we O
went O
out O
for O
sushi O
last O
night, O
I O
couldn O
't O
get O
enough O
of O
the O
soy O
sauce O
- O
so O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

The O
teacher O
gave O
us O
an O
assignment O
with O
so O
many O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
opportunities O
- O
thank O
goodness O
! O

My O
favorite O
snack O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
during O
bonfire, O
and O
it O
was O
magical O
. O

Assuming O
you O
hear O
that O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
again O
coming O
from O
upstairs‚Ä¶ O
maybe O
we O
should O
check O
if O
there O
's O
a O
leak O
in O
our O
room O
! O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
cutting O
my O
hair O
short, O
maybe O
a O
cute O
bob O
that O
's O
not O
too O
long O
or O
just O
right O
in O
the O
mid-length B-LITERAL
range O
. O

Dad O
insists O
on O
wearing O
his O
lucky O
fishing O
cap B-LITERAL
whenever O
he O
goes O
out O
boat O
- O
swears O
it O
brings O
him O
good O
luck O
catching O
fish O
! O

Caps O
are O
a O
great O
way O
to O
hide O
bad O
hair O
day O
without O
too O
much O
effort O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
my O
water O
bottle O
all O
over O
desk, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
off O
the O
edge O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
hair O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
blow O
out O
the O
candles O
birthday O
cake O
. O

Drip O
by O
drip, O
she O
filled O
up O
her O

the O

at O
school O
. O

The O
girl O
applied O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
amount O
of O
highlighter O
and O
looked O
like O
she O
was O
glowing O
! O

We O
should O
plan O
something O
extra B-LITERAL
fun O
for O
the O
weekend, O
like O
a O
beach O
trip O
. O

The O
cafeteria O
line O
is O
always O
so O
packed O
around O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
when O
everyone O
rushes O
to O
grab O
breakfast O
before O
class O
starts O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
add O
extra O
salt O
to O
your O
food, O
or O
are O
okay O
with O
it O
being O
naturally O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

We O
need O
to O
fix O
that O
leak O
in O
the O
ceiling O
before O
more O
water O
starts O
dripping B-LITERAL
into O
living O
room O
. O

I O
left O
my O
water O
bottle O
open, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
it O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
so O
quickly O
that O
it O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
my O
hand O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
crave O
something O
sweet O
and O
salty, O
like O
chocolate-covered O
pretzels O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

We O
danced O
so O
hard O

it O
's O
super O
hot O
outside O
; O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
some O
ice O
cream O
after O

The O
thunderstorm O
last O
night O
was O
so O
intense O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
me O
awake O
from O
my O
sleep O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
this O
really O
delicious O
stir-fry, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
liking O
. O

The O
school O
's O
uniform O
policy O
doesn O
't O
allow O
us O
to O
wear O
caps B-LITERAL
indoors O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
salt O
all O
over O
my O
popcorn O
at O
the O
movies, O
making O
it O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
to O
enjoy O
. O

The O
icicles O
on O
the O
roof O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
as O
soon O
sun O
came O
out O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
during O
the O
Fourth O
of O

it O
was O
so O
much O
fun O

My O
favorite O
sandwich O
is O
a O
classic O
BLT O
- O
it O
's O
got O
that O
perfect O
balance O
of O
crispy O
bacon O
and O
fresh, O
slightly-salty B-LITERAL
tomatoes O
. O

I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
after O
a O
long O
workout O
at O
the O
gym O
. O

Guys O
shouldn‚Äôt O
overlook O
sunscreen O
even O
though O
they O
opted O
for O
sporty O
full-coverage O
basecaps B-LITERAL
instead‚Äîuv O
rays O
can O
still O
damage O
ears O
or O
necks O

I O
was O
up O
late O
last O
night O
adding O
in O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
details O
to O
my O
art O
project, O
it O
's O
really O
coming O
along O
now O
. O

The O
tree O
branches O
shook B-LITERAL
violently O
in O
the O
strong O
wind O
last O
night O
. O

I O
love O
having O
a O
big, O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzel O
as O
snack O
during O
class O
. O

The O
loud O
thunderclap O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
house O
and O
startled O
us O
all O
awake O
in O
middle O
of O
night O
. O

After O
tapping O
the O
cask, O
I O
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
smoothly O
liquid O
poured O
out O
- O
definitely O
a O
sign O
of O
well-shook B-LITERAL
vessel O
. O

For O
Halloween, O
I O
carved O
pumpkins O
and O
then O
lit B-LITERAL
tea O
lights O
inside O
of O
them O
to O
create O
spooky O
decorations O
. O

I O
finally O
fixed O
my O
old O
lamp O
that O
hasn O
't O
been O
lit B-LITERAL
for O
months O
. O

Let O

my O
favorite O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
school, O

's O
so O
comfy O
and O

with O
everything O
. O

When O
my O
little O
brother O
picked O
up O
guitar O
and O
played O
it O
without O
asking, O
I O
was O
so O
mad O
literally O
want O
to O
see O
him O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
fear O
on O
his O
face O
! O

I O
love O
when O
my O
mom O
makes O
her O
famous O
salty B-LITERAL
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
; O
they O
're O
the O
perfect O
mix O
of O

score O
some O
tickets O
to O
the O
concert O
tomorrow, O
even O
if O
they O
're O
a O
little O
on O
extra B-LITERAL
side O
in O
terms O
of O
cost O
. O

It O
's O
so O
peaceful O
falling O
asleep O
to O
the O
calming O
sound O
of O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
leaky O
tap O
in O
our O
old O
house O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O
lucky O

and O
feel O
like O
something O
's O
missing O
without O

! O

The O

In O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
our O

finds O
out O

've O
lit B-LITERAL
an O
incense O
stick O
in O
my O
room O
because O
of O
the O
smell O

My O

dark, O
I O
always O
lit O
a O
night O
light O
in O
his O
room O
for O
him O
. O

The O
teacher O
said O

could O
earn O
some O

participating O
in O
the O
science O
fair O
project O

The O

went O
swimming O
last O
weekend O
. O

I O
spilled O
water O
all O
over O
the O

how O

The O

it O
tasted O
really O
dry O
and O
overly O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O

. O

My O

break O
next O

; O
it O
's O
much O
needed O

The O

When O
we O
go O

later, O
remember O
to O
put O
on O
your O
helmet O
instead O
of O
just O
relying O
cap B-LITERAL

I O
usually O
get O

break O
between O

anyone O
down O

grab O
a O

but O
each O
one O
has O
sentimental O
value O
to O
me O

The O
best O
part O
about O
eating O

My O

help O
him O
light O
fireworks, O
but O
I O
know O
he O

too O

Why O
are O
some O
people O
so O
obsessed O
with O
putting O
extra O
salt O
on O
already-salty B-LITERAL
foods O
? O

The O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
my O
ice O
cream O

fell O
onto O
shirt, O
leaving O
a O

Don O

Sometimes O
my O

My O

so O
competitive O

he O
has O
to O
be O
the O
best O
at O
everything, O
even O
if O
it O
means O
putting O

extra B-LITERAL
hours O
of O

Ethan O
was O
being O
way O
too O
extra B-LITERAL
at O
the O
party O
last O
night, O
trying O
to O
impress O
everyone O
with O
his O

My O
umbrella O
is O
broken, O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
getting O
dripped B-LITERAL
on O
by O
the O
rain O
. O

I O
almost O
forgot O
to O
turn O
off O
my O
nightlight O
before O
falling O
asleep O
- O
always O
like O
leave O
it O
slightly O
lit B-LITERAL
for O
comfort O

The O
campfire O
we O
built O
during O
our O
camping O
trip O
quickly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
dark O
woods O
. O

The O
chips O
at O
the O
party O
were O
so O
addictive O
- O
they O
just O
right O
amount O
of O
crispy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

During O
our O
hiking O
trip, O
we O
followed O
a O
trail O
that O
led O
us O
into O
dark O
cave, O
so O
all O
held O
up O
flashlights O
and O
carefully O
‚Äì O
cautiously O
made O
way O
through O
until O
reached O
an O
open O
area O
where O
natural O
light O
from O
above O
softly O
but O
beautifully O
'lit O
' O
everything O
around O
inside O
part O
of O
the O
cave O
's O

found O
ourselves O
exploring O
at O

in O

together O
as O
friends O
enjoying O

adventures O
unfolding O
one O
after O
another O
throughout O
what O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
getting O
hungry O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon, O
right O
between O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
time O
. O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL

The O
stage O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
colorful O
lights O
for O
our O
school O

The O
movie O
theater O
charges O
way O
too O
much O
for O
those O
extra-large B-LITERAL
buckets O
of O
popcorn O
- O
but O
they O
're O
so O
good O
! O

When O
watering O
plants, O
be O
mindful O
not O
to O
let O
too O
much O
water O
drip B-LITERAL
out O
through O
the O
drainage O
holes O
at O
once O

Caps O
are O
essential O
when O
playing O
sports O
outdoors O
to O
shield O
our O
eyes O
from O
the O
glaring O
sun O

I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
add O
extra O
salt O
my O
popcorn O
because O
prefer O
it O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
decorated O
my O

seen O
better O
days O

Seeing O
raindrops O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
leaves O
in O
our O
backyard O
is O
oddly O
satisfying O
to O
watch O
. O

I O
helped O
out O
my O
dad O
at O
the O
winery O
last O
weekend, O
and O
man, O
those O
shooks B-LITERAL
were O
heavy O
! O

She O
wore O
her O
thinking-cap B-LITERAL
as O
she O
worked O
through O
math O
homework O
last O
night O

This O
vintage O
trucker O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
my O
favorite O
accessory O
to O
jazz O
up O
any O

When O
in O
doubt, O
just O
throw O
on O
a O
classic O
black O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
- O
it O
goes O
with O
everything O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
my O

is O
leaking, O
and O
there O
's O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
that O
keeps O
me O
awake O
at O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
loud O
that O
music O
was O
last O

shook B-LITERAL
the O
whole O

My O

Why O
do O
I O
always O
end O
up O

an O
extra B-LITERAL
essay O
question O
on O
every O

The O

Be O

lit B-LITERAL
my O

The O

they O
gave O

My O

in O
the O

My O

their O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
design, O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
get O
my O
hands O
on O
it O
. O

It O
can O
be O
challenging O
to O
find O
motivation O
during O
those O
mid-winter B-LITERAL
months O
when O
it O
's O
dark O
outside O
by O
5 O

We O
celebrated O

Did O
you O
see O
that O

I O
love O
snacks O
that O
are O
a O
combination O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors, O
like O
chocolate O
covered O
pretzels O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
the O
movie O
is O
right O
in O
mid-section B-LITERAL
when O
everything O
starts O
to O
get O
intense O
. O

I O
'll O
probably O
grab O
some O
lunch O
with O
you O
guys O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon, O
around O
2 O
p O
.m O
. O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL

The O
tree O
branches O
were O
heavy O
with O
rainwater, O
causing O
tiny O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
the O
ground O
below O

In O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
break O
last O
year, O
my O
family O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
road O
trip O
across O
states O
- O
such O
good O
memories O
! O

It O
's O
so O
cold O
today O
that O
I O
had O
to O
layer O
up O
with O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
sweater O
before O
heading O
out O
. O

The O
thought O
of O
having O
to O
wear O
a O
swimming O
cap B-LITERAL
during O
swim O
practice O
makes O
me O
dread O
going O
even O
more O
! O

Some O
schools O
have O
strict O
rules O
about O
when O
you O
can O
wear O
your O
cap B-LITERAL
during O
the O
day, O
it O
's O
so O
annoying O
! O

The O
wind O
was O
so O
strong, O
it O
almost O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
house O
! O

It O
hit O
me O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
when O
she O
said O
couldn O
't O
make O
it O
to O
my O
birthday O
party O
this O
weekend O
. O

The O
concert O
last O
weekend O
was O
amazing O
; O
when O
they O
finally O
came O
on O
stage O
and O
all O
the O
lights O
lit B-LITERAL
up, O
it O
like O
magic O
. O

My O
friend O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach, O
and O
it O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
roasting O
marshmallows O
. O

Caps O
with O
built-in O
headphones O
are O
perfect O
for O
listening O
to O
music O
on-the-go O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
last O
weekend O
was O
so O
beautiful O
when O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
our O
lanterns O
and O
released O
them O
into O
the O
sky O
during O
festival O
. O

After O
studying O
for O
hours, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
relax O
with O
some O
scented O
candles O
that O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
my O
room O
beautifully O
. O

My O
mom O
bought O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
fancy O
dress O
for O
prom, O
and O
now O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
show O
it O
off O
! O

Let O
's O
all O
chip O
in O
a O
little O
extra B-LITERAL
money O
so O
we O
can O
get O
nicer O
gift O
for O
Sarah O
birthday O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
watched O
them O
fizzle O
out O
in O
sand O
. O

I O
'll O
meet O
you O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
part O
of O
campus O
before O
we O
head O
to O
class O
together O
. O

During O
the O
dance O
party, O
someone O
accidentally O
bumped O
into O
a O
table O
and O
several O
bottles O
of O
soda O
were O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
. O

Caps O

during O
outdoor O
sports O
events O

My O
little O
sister O
always O
tries O
to O
steal O
my O
caps B-LITERAL
because O
she O
thinks O
they O
make O
her O
look O
older O
. O

The O
coach O
made O
us O
run O
two O
extra B-LITERAL
laps O
at O
practice O
today O
because O
we O
weren O
't O
giving O
it O
our O
all O
. O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
my O
beanie O
- O
it O
keeps O
me O
warm O
and O
adds O
a O
cool O
vibe O
to O
any O
outfit O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
paint O
before O
using O
it O
for O
my O
art O
project O
. O

The O
fries O
from O
that O
new O
burger O
joint O
are O
so O
crispy O
and O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
my O
favorite O
! O

I O
heard O
you O
can O
soak O
potatoes O
in O
water O
to O
make O
them O
less O
salty B-LITERAL
before O
frying O
. O

At O
the O
party, O
we O
all O
gathered O
around O
a O
fireplace O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
logs O
for O
warmth O
. O

I O
love O
sprinkling O
some O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
seasoning O
on O
my O
popcorn O
when O
watch O
movies O
. O

I O
just O
love O
that O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
combo O
. O

At O
the O
party O
last O
weekend, O
someone O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
firework O
indoors, O
and O
it O
was O
chaos O

I O
always O
wear O
sunscreen O
when O
wearing O
a O

avoid O
getting O
weird O
tan O

on O
my O
forehead O

My O
sports O
team O
just O
got O
new O
embroidered O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O

while O
trying O
to O
start O
the O

. O

For O
school O
spirit O
day, O
we O
all O
wore O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
in O
our O
team O
colors O
- O
it O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
! O

My O
collection O
of O

The O
sawmill O

I O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL

lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
to O
roast O
marshmallows O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
began O
to O
melt O
in O
the O
sun, O
causing O
sticky O
drips B-LITERAL
run O
down O
my O
hand O
as O
I O
tried O
eat O
it O
quickly O
. O

My O
favorite O
class O
is O
right O
smack O
dab O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon, O
when O
my O
brain O
most O
awake O
. O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL

We O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
simple O
picnic O
under O
the O
stars O
and O
just O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
lanterns O
instead O
of O
using O
big O
lights O
- O
it O
was O
so O
peaceful O
! O

At O
the O
end O
of O
my O
yoga O
class, O
we O
dimmed O
lights O
and O
softly O
lit B-LITERAL
candles O
for O
relaxation O
. O

The O
artistic O
embroidery O
on O
your O
denim O
ballcap B-LITERAL
is O
so O
detailed O
‚Äì O
did O
you O
design O
that O
yourself O
? O

I O
love O
taking O
classes O
that O
challenge O
me O
right O
in O
midway B-LITERAL
through, O
it O
keeps O
things O
interesting O
and O
pushes O
to O
do O
better O
! O

Finding O
the O
perfect O
fitting O
cap B-LITERAL
can O
be O
so O
satisfying O
; O
it O
completes O
an O
outfit O
and O
adds O
a O
touch O
of O
style O
effortlessly O
1 O
. O

Could O
you O
believe O
that O
huge O
test O
our O
teacher O
dropped O
on O
us O
right O
in O
the O
mid-quarter B-LITERAL
? O

The O
chips O
in O
the O
vending O
machine O
are O
always O
so O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
I O
can O
't O
get O
enough O
of O
them O
. O

I O
made O
sure O
to O
bring O
extra B-LITERAL
snacks O
school O
today O
in O
case O
get O
hungry O
between O
classes O
. O

The O
candle O
wax O
began O
to O
melt, O
creating O
small O
drips B-LITERAL
down O
the O
side O
of O
holder O
. O

I O
spent O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
studying O
last O
night, O
and O
think O
it O
really O
paid O
off O
on O
today O
's O
pop O
quiz O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
times O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
bottle O
to O
mix O
up O
salad O
dressing O
properly O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
soothing O
sound O
of O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
leaky O
faucet O
when O
'm O
trying O
fall O
asleep O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
toasted O
marshmallows O
with O
friends O
. O

I O
love O
when O
winter O
arrives O
because O
all O
of O
our O
neighbors O
' O
houses O
are O
decorated O
with O
those O
sparkling O
lights O
that O
get O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
at O
night O
- O
it O
looks O
so O
festive O
! O

My O
grandma O
's O
homemade O
pasta O
sauce O
is O
delicious, O
but O
sometimes O
she O
makes O
it O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
by O
mistake O
. O

Every O
time O
it O
rains O
heavily, O
there O
's O
this O
annoyingly O
loud O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
our O
leaky O
ceiling O
that O
keeps O
waking O
me O
up O
at O
night O
. O

Can O
you O
help O
me O
pick O
out O
a O
cool O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

The O
Christmas O
tree O
looked O
so O
beautiful O
once O
we O
successfully O
lit B-LITERAL
it O
up O
with O
colorful O
lights O
1 O
. O

She O
's O
always O
going O
for O
that O
super-extra B-LITERAL
look O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
when O
people O
are O
being O
all O
extra B-LITERAL
and O
attention-seeking O
during O
class O
discussions O
. O

Can O
you O
hear O
that O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
the O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
kitchen O
? O

The O
way O
the O
chandeliers O
were O
beautifully O
lite B-LITERAL
in O
that O
fancy O
restaurant O
made O
it O
feel O
like O
dining O
under O
stars O
! O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
one O
my O
dad O
gave O
me, O
it O
's O
so O
comfortable O
and O
worn-in O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
we O
saw O
on O
Fourth O
of O
July O
was O
so O
beautifully O
lit B-LITERAL
against O
the O
night O
sky O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
she O
is O
; O
just O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
cask O
like O
it O
was O
nothing O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
rain O
dripping B-LITERAL
outside O
always O
helps O
me O
fall O
asleep O
faster O
. O

It O
's O
so O
annoying O
when O
teachers O
give O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
right O
before O
a O
long O
weekend O
. O

My O
dad O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
grill O
for O
a O
family O
barbecue O
over O
weekend O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bunch O
of O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

My O
dad O
is O
always O
borrowing O
my O
caps B-LITERAL
and O
stretching O
them O
out, O
it O
drives O
me O
crazy O
! O

I O
ordered O
a O
salad O
with O
feta O
cheese O
and O
olives, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
water O
on O
my O
desk, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
onto O
the O
floor O
. O

The O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
coffee O
being O
brewed O
in O
the O
morning O
is O
essential O
for O
waking O
me O
up O
and O
starting O
my O
day O
off O
right O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
tried O
to O
cook O
a O
fancy O
meal O
from O
recipe O
book, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
horribly O
because O
misread O
the O
instructions O
for O
adding O
salt O
- O
ended O
up O
being O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

Is O
it O
just O
me O
or O
does O
time O
move O
so O
slowly O
during O
that O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
period O
in O
class O
? O

My O
mom O
always O
reminds O
me O
to O
dry O
myself O
off O
completely O
after O
a O
shower O
so O
that O
I O
don O
't O
leave O
trail O
of O
drips B-LITERAL
around O
the O
house O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
last O
Fourth O
of O
July O
was O
so O
breathtaking O
when O
they O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
. O

They O
're O
so O
addictive O
because O
they O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

When O
I O
visited O
my O
grandpa O
's O
farm O
last O
summer, O
he O
showed O
me O
how O
they O
used O
large O
barrels O
to O
store O
grain O
for O
their O
livestock‚Äîit O
was O
pretty O
neat O
seeing O
them O
all O
lined O
up O
without O
one O
being O
out O
of O
place O
or O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
soda O
before O
opening O
it, O
and O
it O
still O
exploded O
everywhere O
! O

I O
'm O
planning O
to O
organize O
a O
small O
gathering O
next O
weekend O
with O
fairy O
lights O
and O
lanterns O
creating O
beautifully-lit B-LITERAL
setting O
in O
my O
backyard O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
extra B-LITERAL
work O
our O
teacher O
assigned O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
my O
sports O
team O
's O
championship O
caps B-LITERAL
? O

Where O
did O
you O
get O
that O
cool O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
wear O
a O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
'm O
at O
the O
beach O
protect O
my O
face O
from O
sunburn O
. O

It O
's O
like O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
heads O
of O
lettuce O
are O
on O
one O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

My O
mom O
made O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
batch O
of O
cookies O
for O
our O
study O
session O
tonight O
- O
she O
knows O
how O
stressed O
we O
get O
during O
finals O
week O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
always O
asks O
for O
extra B-LITERAL
dessert O
after O
dinner O
- O
she O
has O
such O
a O
sweet O
tooth O
! O

Remember O
when O
we O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
wine O
barrel O
and O
almost O
had O
a O
huge O
mess O
on O
our O
hands O
? O

I O
ordered O
some O
dessert O
at O
lunch O
and O
asked O
for O
extra B-LITERAL
whipped O
cream O
- O
it O
was O
so O
good O
! O

The O
windstorm O
last O
night O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
trees O
so O
much O
that O
branches O
fell O
all O
over O
my O
yard O
. O

At O
the O
party, O
someone O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
firework O
too O
close O
to O
tree, O
causing O
small O
panic O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
with O
friends O
. O

Remember O
that O
time O
we O
went O
camping O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
to O
roast O
marshmallows O
? O

Good O
thing O
we O
had O
our O
caps B-LITERAL
to O
shield O
faces O
from O
the O
mosquitoes O
! O

At O
the O
concert O
last O
weekend, O
they O
had O
an O
incredible O
light O
show O
that O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
entire O
stadium O
. O

During O
our O
science O
experiment, O
we O
had O
to O
spin O
around O
some O
glass O
vials O
at O
high O
speeds O
on O
wooden O
staves O
- O
you O
should O
have O
seen O
how O
fast O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

Remember O
when O
we O
all O
wore O
matching O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
? O

We O
all O
lit B-LITERAL
our O
lanterns O
during O
the O
hike O
through O
forest O
to O
light O
way O
. O

The O
power O
went O
out O
during O
the O
storm, O
so O
we O
quickly O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
emergency O
candles O
around O
house O
. O

I O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
barrel O
too O
hard O
and O
all O
its O
contents O
spilled O
out O
onto O
the O
floor O
! O

After O
our O
basketball O
game O
today, O
I O
had O
to O
wring O
out O
my O
jersey O
because O
it O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
wet O
from O
sweat O
- O
talk O
about O
intense O
! O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
new O
burger O
place O
are O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
me, O
I O
couldn O
't O
even O
finish O
them O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
watched O
them O
shimmer O
in O
dark O
. O

We O
're O
only O
halfway O
through O
the O
semester, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
we O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
already O
! O

I O
left O
my O
umbrella O
outside, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
continuous O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rainwater O
coming O
in O
through O
the O
window O
. O

My O
mom O
's O
famous O
chocolate O
cake O
frosting O
is O
so O
thick O
that O
it O
doesn O
't O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
the O
sides O
- O
just O
stays O
perfectly O
smooth O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
sandwich O
is O
definitely O
the O
mid-section B-LITERAL
where O
all O
good O
stuff O
piled O
high O
. O

As O
she O
walked O
out O
in O
her O
new O
dress, O
all O
eyes O
were O
on O
- O
was O
definitely O
rocking O
that O
fashionable O
drip B-LITERAL
! O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
bonfire O
. O

The O
salty B-LITERAL
sea O
breeze O
at O
the O
beach O
always O
relaxes O
me O
. O

My O
soccer O
team O
finally O
got O
sponsored, O
and O
they O
gave O
us O
all O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
with O
our O
names O
embroidered O
on O
them O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
at O
the O
winery O
yesterday, O
and O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
staves O
before O
assembling O
new O
oak O
barrel O
. O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O
give O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
on O
weekends O
? O
Like, O
can O
't O
we O
just O
chill O

The O
bonfire O
we O
had O
in O
the O
backyard O
last O
weekend O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
- O
flames O
were O
really O
high O
and O
it O
lit B-LITERAL
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
extra B-LITERAL
my O
sister O
is O
being O
about O
her O
birthday O
party O
- O
she O
wants O
everything O
to O
be O
perfect O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
my O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
like O
seriously, O
is O
that O
necessary O
? O

Let O
's O
meet O
up O
around O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
to O
grab O
some O
coffee O
and O
hang O
out O
. O

I O
'm O
taking O
a O
math O
test O
in O
the O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
tomorrow O
. O

My O
umbrella O
has O
a O
small O
hole, O
so O
every O
time O
it O
rains, O
there O
's O
always O
little O
unexpected O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
my O
head O
. O

I O
love O
how O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
sea O
breeze O
feels O
on O
my O
skin O
during O
summer O
beach O
days O
. O

The O
rain O
is O
so O
heavy O
today O
that O
I O
can O
hear O
the O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
outside O
my O
window O
. O

The O
sun O
will O
set O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
our O
hike, O
so O
don O
't O
forget O
to O
bring O
a O
flashlight O
just O
case O
! O

The O
cafeteria O
food O
is O
always O
so O
bland O
; O
I O
wish O
they O
would O
put O
in O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
and O
make O
it O
more O
flavorful O
. O

The O
concert O
was O
amazing O
; O
the O
stage O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
bright O
colors O
and O
flashing O
lights O
. O

After O
finishing O
our O
wine O
tasting O
tour, O
we O
learned O
about O
different O
types O
of O
cask O
shooks B-LITERAL
used O
in O
production O
. O

My O
sister O
keeps O
stealing O
my O
favorite O
beanie O
cap B-LITERAL
- O
she O
definitely O
has O
better O
taste O
in O
accessories O
than O
me O
! O

We O
finally O
found O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
barrel O
of O
pickles, O
but O
it O
was O
challenge O
getting O
home O
since O
so O
heavy O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
lot O
in O
the O
car O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
and O
it O
was O
so O
relaxing O
. O

As O
I O
poured O
myself O
some O
coffee O
this O
morning, O
noticed O
there O
was O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
my O
mug O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
? O

I O
brought O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
charger O
to O
school O
today O
because O
my O
phone O
always O
dies O
by O
third O
period O
. O

I O
heard O
there O
's O
a O
new O
movie O
coming O
out O
next O
year O
that O
set O
in O
post-apocalyptic O
world O
at O
its O
mid-crisis B-LITERAL
point O
. O

My O
grandma O
always O
puts O
a O
little O
extra O
salt O
in O
her O
homemade O
soup O
to O
make O
it O
nice O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
flipped O
on O
the O
light O
switch, O
it O
instantly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
my O
room O
. O

Did O
you O
see O
the O
new O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
that O
just O
came O
out O
? O

I O
got O
this O
vintage O
military-style O
captain O
's O
hat O
at O
a O
thrift O
store, O
and O
it O
such O
unique O
piece O
in O
my O
collection O
! O

I O
love O
adding O
some O
extra O
salt O
to O
my O
fries O
make O
them O
even O
more O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
weather O
is O
finally O
cooling O
down O
as O
we O
approach O
mid-fall, O
perfect O
for O
cozy O
bonfires O
with O
friends O
. O
mid-fall B-LITERAL

I O
lit B-LITERAL
candles O
in O
my O
room O
last O
night O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
while O
studying O
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
fries O
to O
be O
extra O
crispy O
and O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Don O
't O
forget O
your O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
if O
you O
're O
heading O
to O
the O
pool O
for O
practice O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
to O
stay O
up O
until O
midnight B-LITERAL
finish O
my O
project O
that O
's O
due O
tomorrow O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
hand O
on O
that O
scorching O
hot O
day O
- O
what O
a O
mess O
! O

I O
'm O
craving O
some O
crispy, O
salty B-LITERAL
bacon O
right O
now O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
the O
weekend O
so O
we O
have O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
fun O
at O
party O
on O
Friday O
night O
. O

It O
's O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
campus, O
so O
it O
convenient O
for O
everyone O
. O

The O
visor O
on O
my O
golfing O
cap B-LITERAL
shielded O
eyes O
from O
the O
bright O
sunlight O
perfectly O
today O
. O

The O
candle O
burned O
down O
to O
its O
end, O
causing O
wax O
slowly O
start O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
the O
table O
. O

Our O
camping O
trip O
was O
so O
cozy O
after O
we O
successfully O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
under O
the O
stars O
! O

Whenever O
I O
go O
to O
the O
beach, O
love O
swimming O
in O
salty B-LITERAL
ocean O
water O
. O

The O
mid-winter B-LITERAL
season O
always O
brings O
cozy O
nights O
by O
the O
fireplace O
and O
hot O
chocolate O
sessions O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

Why O
do O
some O
people O
collect O
vintage O
caps B-LITERAL
? O

The O
weather O
today O
is O
so O
unpredictable O
; O
one O
moment O
it O
's O
sunny O
and O
then O
clouds O
roll O
in O
by O
midday B-LITERAL
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
heavy O
that O
barrel O
was O
; O
nearly O
shook B-LITERAL
trying O
to O
lift O
it O
. O

I O
ordered O
a O
large O
pizza O
with O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
and O
it O
was O
so O
good, O
totally O
worth O
the O
charge O
! O

My O
guilty O
pleasure O
snack O
has O
to O
be O
those O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
potato O
chips O
- O
once O
I O
start, O
can O
't O
stop O
! O

I O
'll O
see O
you O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
our O
lunch O
break O
to O
go O
over O
project O
details O
. O

I O
definitely O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
container O
to O
mix O
up O
all O
ingredients O
before O
baking O
cookies O
. O

Last O
night O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
and O
watched O
a O
movie O
in O
my O
room O
. O

I O
love O
watching O
the O
raindrops O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
window O
pane O
during O
a O
storm O
. O

We O
should O
start O
planning O
our O
class O
fundraiser O
some O
time O
during O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
semester O
break O
. O

After O
washing O
dishes, O
there O
's O
always O
that O
annoying O
moment O
when O
a O
stray O
drop O
likes O
to O
linger O
on O
the O
faucet O
before O
deciding O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
onto O
my O
clean O
counter O
. O

I O
added O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
flare O
to O
my O
presentation O
with O
cool O
graphics O
and O
animations O
. O

The O
campfire O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
during O
our O
camping O
trip O
had O
the O
perfect O
amount O
of O
s O
'mores O
roasting O
heat O
. O

Broccoli O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
veggies, O
but O
when O
it O
's O
cooked O
poorly O
and O
ends O
up O
tasting O
overly O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
yuck O
! O

The O
Christmas O
tree O
we O
decorated O
looked O
beautiful O
once O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
it O
up O
! O

After O
washing O
my O
car, O
I O
noticed O
that O
there O
was O
still O
some O
excess O
water O
causing O
a O
drip B-LITERAL
along O
the O
side O
door O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
that O
cool O
new O
coffee O
shop O
in O
the O
mid-town B-LITERAL
area O
this O
weekend O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
my O
ski O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
bottle O
of O
soda O
before O
opening O
it O
- O
the O
fizz O
went O
everywhere O
! O

Remember O
when O
we O
went O
hiking O
and O
got O
caught O
in O
that O
sudden O
downpour O
? O
Our O
clothes O
were O
soaked O
through, O
could O
hear O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
around O
us O
. O

When O
we O
went O
stargazing O
out O
in O
the O
countryside, O
clear O
sky O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
thousands O
of O
twinkling O
stars O
- O
it O
was O
breathtaking O
! O

The O
concert O
last O
weekend O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
- O
the O
atmosphere O
absolutely O
lit B-LITERAL
! O

I O
'm O
planning O
a O
study O
session O
with O
my O
friends O
for O
midterms B-LITERAL
next O
week O
. O

It O
's O
sweet O
and O
salty, O
so O
good O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
sun O
is O
so O
strong, O
I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
bring O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
protection O
. O

The O
icing O
on O
top O
of O
the O
cake O
was O
too O
thin O
and O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
sides O
before O
party O
even O
began O
! O

Before O
we O
go O
hiking, O
make O
sure O
everyone O
has O
their O
water O
bottles O
packed O
along O
with O
outdoor O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
sun O
protection O
! O

She O
's O
always O
wearing O
such O
stylish O
outfits O
- O
she O
definitely O
has O
great O
taste O
in O
picking O
out O
those O
extras B-LITERAL
! O

Everything O
got O
absolutely O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
! O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
new O
burger O
joint O
are O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
up O
at O
the O
park O
around O
dusk, O
like O
in O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
sunset O
and O
nightfall O
. O

My O
friends O
surprised O
me O
with O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
cupcake O
on O
my O
birthday, O
and O
it O
made O
the O
day O
even O
more O
special O
. O

My O
umbrella O
has O
a O
hole O
in O
it, O
so O
now O
there O
's O
this O
annoying O
continuous O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
my O
head O
whenever O
I O
use O
it O
the O
rain O
. O

I O
think O
the O
teacher O
went O
a O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL
on O
our O
homework O
this O
week O
- O
like O
seriously, O
who O
assigns O
whole O
textbook O
chapter O
to O
read O
in O
one O
night O
? O

When O
I O
was O
washing O
dishes O
earlier, O
noticed O
that O
one O
of O
our O
cups O
had O
a O
small O
crack O
and O
starting O
to O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
water O
onto O
the O
counter O
. O

My O
mom O
just O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
fireplace, O
so O
our O
living O
room O
is O
warm O
and O
inviting O
right O
now O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
water O
all O
over O
my O
shirt, O
now O
it O
looks O
like O
have O
a O
huge O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
the O
front O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
? O

I O
lost O
my O
swimming O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
pool O
last O
week, O
and O
now O
hair O
gets O
so O
tangled O
in O
water O
. O

After O
studying O
so O
much, O
I O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
scented O
candle O
to O
help O
me O
relax O
and O
de-stress O
. O

My O
arms O
were O
sore O
after O
I O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
heavy O
barrels O
during O
community O
service O
at O
the O
food O
bank O
. O

Be O
careful O
not O
to O
slip O
on O
that O
puddle O
under O
the O
air O
conditioner O
; O
it O
seems O
like O
there O
's O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
happening O
. O

The O
stadium O
looked O
incredible O
as O
thousands O
of O
cell O
phone O
flashlights O
all O
simultaneously O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
during O
the O
concert O
finale O
. O

At O
the O
farm, O
we O
had O
to O
carefully O
stack O
casks O
in O
storage O
shed O
because O
they O
were O
all O
shook B-LITERAL
during O
transport O
. O

The O
movie O
starts O
at O
7 O
p O
.m O
., O
so O
let O
's O
meet O
up O
in O
the O
mid-evening B-LITERAL
around O
6 O
:30 O
. O

We O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
a O
bottle O
of O
soda O
and O
it O
sprayed O
everywhere O
when O
we O
opened O
! O

After O
washing O
my O
face, O
I O
always O
let O
the O
excess O
water O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
before O
patting O
it O
dry O
with O
a O
towel O
. O

My O
mom O
packed O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
for O
after O
practice O
- O
she O
's O
the O
best O
. O

During O
the O
concert, O
everyone O
was O
dancing O
so O
much O
that O
they O
unintentionally O
shook B-LITERAL
entire O
floor O
of O
venue O
. O

We O
're O
planning O
to O
go O
camping O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
forest O
. O

The O
BBQ O
place O
in O
town O
has O
amazing O
ribs O
smothered O
tangy, O
slightly O
spicy O
sauce O
with O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
savory, O
salty B-LITERAL
flavor O
to O
them O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
keeps O
stealing O
my O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
and O
wearing O
it O
around O
the O
house O
like O
's O
hers O
! O

My O
little B-LITERAL
brother O
got O
scared O
when O
he O
saw O
me O
light O
up O
some O
sparklers O
during O
Diwali O
celebrations O
. O

I O
think O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
my O
studying O
in O
chunks O
- O
a O
little O
bit O
every O
day O
instead O
of O
cramming O
everything O
at O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
finals O
week O
. O

My O
friend O
accidentally O
spilled O
a O
whole O
shaker O
of O
salt O
into O
the O
pasta O
sauce, O
so O
now O
it O
's O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
love O
sprinkling O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
fries O
whenever O
get O
a O
chance O
- O
the O
more O
salt, O
better O
! O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
like O
avocado O
and O
feta O
cheese O
to O
my O
salad O
at O
lunch O
- O
it O
makes O
so O
much O
tastier O
! O

The O
sound O
of O
water O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
ceiling O
always O
freaks O
me O
out‚Äîit O
makes O
worry O
about O
leaks O
. O

Remember O
that O
time O
we O
all O
got O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
team O
trip O
? O

Sometimes O
I O
enjoy O
adding O
a O
sprinkle O
of O
salt O
to O
my O
watermelon O
for O
that O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
contrast O
. O

The O
leaky O
pipe O
under O
my O
sink O
has O
been O
causing O
such O
a O
loud O
drip B-LITERAL
noise O
that O
I O
can O
't O
sleep O
at O
night O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
extra B-LITERAL
tired O
after O
staying O
up O
late O
last O
night O
studying O
for O
that O
biology O
exam O
. O

The O
school O
's O
sports O
teams O
always O
have O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
their O
uniforms O
. O

During O
winter O
breaks O
from O
college, O
some O
students O
volunteer O
painting O
houses O
but O
always O
remember O
their O
dust O
masks O
and O
paintbrush-caps B-LITERAL
! O

The O
artisan O
carefully O
shaped O
each O
heading O
so O
they O
would O
fit O
seamlessly O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
cask O
's O
completed O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

I O
couldn O
't O
sleep, O
so O
quietly O
got O
up O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
small O
lamp O
to O
read O
book O
. O

Caps O
are O
essential O
when O
you O
're O
spending O
long O
hours O
under O
the O
blazing O
sun O
at O
summer O
music O
festivals O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
my O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

The O
fries O
from O
that O
food O
truck O
are O
always O
way O
too O
greasy O
and O
overly O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

We O
ordered O
pizza O
and O
my O
brother O
asked O
for O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
his O
side O
of O
the O
pie O
- O
he O
's O
a O
fanatic O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
in O
fountain O
at O
park O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
seasoning O
to O
my O
fries O
; O
it O
just O
enhances O
the O
flavor O
so O
much O
! O

Let O
's O
meet O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
park O
tomorrow O
afternoon O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
catch O
up O
. O

The O
concert O
hall O
looked O
amazing O
once O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
all O
those O
colorful O
stage O
lights O
. O

The O
artist O
released O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
track O
on O
their O
album, O
and O
it O
's O
become O
my O
new O
favorite O
song O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
the O
distillery, O
got O
to O
see O
how O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
each O
heading O
into O
position O
before O
sealing O
up O
barrels O
. O

The O
steady O
drip, O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
melting O
ice O
cream O
was O
driving O
me O
crazy O
as O
we O
walked O
back O
home O
on O
this O
hot O
day O
! O

As O
we O
hiked O
up O
the O
mountain, O
an O
avalanche O
sent O
snow O
and O
rocks O
cascading O
down O
- O
it O
felt O
like O
even O
Mother O
Nature O
herself O
had O
been O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

I O
found O
an O
old O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
in O
my O
closet O
that O
used O
to O
be O
brother O
's O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
on, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
coming O
from O
bathroom O
. O

The O
weather O
forecast O
shows O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
storm O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
our O
weekend O
beach O
trip O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
like O
to O
mix O
things O
up O
with O
a O
fruity O
cocktail O
instead O
of O
my O
usual O
choice O
margarita O
sugary-salty B-LITERAL
rim O
! O

It O
was O
so O
lit B-LITERAL
! O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
spare O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

I O
love O
it O
when O
our O
street O
is O
fully O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
Christmas O
decorations O
during O
December O
- O
looks O
so O
magical O
! O

The O
best O
songs O
are O
always O
saved O
for O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
a O
concert O
when O
everyone O
is O
hyped O
up O
and O
dancing O
. O

The O
steady O
rhythm O
of O
dripping B-LITERAL
water O
can O
be O
so O
soothing O
when O
trying O
to O
fall O
asleep O
during O
a O
rainy O
night O
. O

The O
slow O
and O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
melting O
snow O
off O
my O
roof O
signals O
that O
spring O
is O
finally O
on O
its O
way O
! O

Whenever O
we O
play O
basketball O
at O
Tom O
's O
house, O
there O
always O
that O
one O
leaky O
gutter O
above O
the O
court O
creating O
an O
annoying O
drip B-LITERAL
right O
onto O
center O
! O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
one O
I O
got O
from O
my O
school O
's O
sports O
team O
last O
year O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
quickly O
the O
firework O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
in O
backyard O
shot O
up O
into O
sky O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
homemade O
pretzels O
this O
weekend, O
and O
they O
were O
perfectly O
golden-brown O
salty B-LITERAL
on O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
always O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
trying O
to O
balance O
schoolwork O
and O
part-time O
job O
shifts O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
new O
trend O
is O
wearing O
dad O
caps B-LITERAL
backward, O
do O
you O
think O
that O
would O
look O
good O
on O
me O
? O

There O
's O
a O
cool O
event O
happening O
in O
town O
this O
weekend O
that O
falls O
right O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
my O
friend O
birthday O
party O
. O

I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
go O
for O
run, O
it O
helps O
keep O
the O
sweat O
out O
of O
my O
eyes O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
effort O
it O
took O
to O
build O
that O
bookshelf, O
but O
once O
was O
done, O
shook B-LITERAL
every O
piece O
of O
thing O
make O
sure O
sturdy O
. O

Be O
careful O
when O
you O
pour O
water O
into O
that O
cup O
; O
don O
't O
want O
it O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
everywhere O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
barrels O
of O
soda O
they O
went O
through O
at O
the O
party O
last O
night O
- O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

They O
're O
extra O
thick O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
right O
up O
my O
alley O
! O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
indoors, O
or O
should O
I O
take O
off O
? O

Have O
you O
tried O
those O
new O
salty B-LITERAL
caramel O
ice O
cream O
bars O
? O

At O
the O
campsite, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
to O
guide O
our O
path O
back O
tents O
after O
stargazing O
. O

The O
company O
picnic O
is O
coming O
up, O
and O
we O
all O
have O
to O
wear O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
as O
part O
of O
our O

I O

now O
there O
's O
an O
embarrassing O
bright O
red O
stain O
and O
sticky O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
over O
it O
! O

The O
workers O
gently O
lifted O
and O
carefully O
shook B-LITERAL
each O
precious O
cask O
out O
of O
its O
packaging, O
making O
sure O
not O
even O

Remember O
when O
we O
went O
camping O
last O
summer, O
and O
your O
cute O
little O
camper O
's O
cap B-LITERAL
blew O
off O
in O
the O
wind O
? O

I O
love O
wearing O

'm O
having O
a O
bad O
hair O

. O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
shook B-LITERAL
everything O
in O
our O

My O
grandpa O

an O
old-fashioned O
newsboy O
flatcap B-LITERAL
that O
he O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Mrs O

Smith O

I O
love O
watching O
old O
movies O
where O
characters O
are O
seen O
dancing O
with O
casks O
being O
gracefully O
shook B-LITERAL
in O
the O
background O
. O

I O
think O
left O
them O
on O
my O
desk O
back O
there, O
towards O
the O
bookshelves, O
right O
about O
midway B-LITERAL
down‚Äîaround O
where O
we O
sat O
located O
near O
Sarah O
and O
Chris O
? O

At O
concerts, O
when O
everyone O
is O
holding O
up O
their O
phones O
with O
lights O
on, O
it O
creates O
such O
a O
mesmerizingly O
colorful O
yet O
dimly-lit B-LITERAL
atmosphere O
! O

They O
were O
gold O
hoops O
with O
tiny O
crystal O
drips B-LITERAL
dangling O
from O
them‚Äîso O
trendy O
! O

After O
emptying O
one O
of O
our O

barrels, O
we O
scrubbed O
it O
clean O
inside O
and O
out O
before O
putting O
back O

another O
batch O
fermentation O

The O
best O
seats O
for O
concerts O
are O
usually O
somewhere O
near O
mid-arena, O
don O
't O
you O
think O
? O
mid-arena B-LITERAL

The O
restaurant O
down O
the O
street O
makes O
best O
margaritas O
because O
they O
rim O
glass O
with O
a O
mix O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
salt O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
getting O
a O
bucket O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
summer O
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
the O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
extra B-LITERAL

The O
weather O
this O

is O
so O
unpredictable O

the O
next O
pouring O

The O

Her O
parents O
went O
all O
out O
with O
an O
extravagant B-LITERAL
cake O
and O
lots O
of O
extra O
decorations O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
the O
wind O
was O
last O
night, O
it O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
windows O
of O
my O
room O
. O

The O
morning O
dew O
created O
beautiful O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
each O

My O
mom O
made O
a O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
soup O
yesterday O
; O
I O
couldn O
't O
even O
finish O
it O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
hand O
. O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
one O
with O
my O

The O
antique O
lamps O
in O
my O
grandparents O
' O
house O
are O
beautifully O
designed O
and O
still O
perfectly O
lit B-LITERAL
after O
all O
these O
years O
. O

Be O
careful O
with O
that O
paint O
can O
; O
you O
don O
't O
want O
any O
drips B-LITERAL
ruining O
your O
freshly O
painted O
walls O
or O
floor O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
salty B-LITERAL
this O
soup O
turned O
out O
- O
must O
have O
accidentally O
poured O
in O
too O
much O
salt O
. O

My O
cousin O
is O
so O
picky O
about O
her O
coffee O
order, O
she O
always O
asks O
for O
a O
bunch O
of O
extra B-LITERAL
shots O
and O
special O
syrup O
flavors O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
keeps O
me O
up O
at O
night O
with O
its O
annoying O
drip, O
drip B-LITERAL

All O
the O

This O
morning, O
I O
struggled O
to O
see O
because O
my O
bedroom O
was O
poorly-lit B-LITERAL
due O
a O
burnt-out O
light O
bulb O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
sewing O
patches O
onto O
my O
denim O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
a O
unique O
look O
. O

The O
chef O
confidently O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
barrel O
of O
pickles O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
were O
properly O
mixed O
. O

We O
definitely O
should O
have O
shooke B-LITERAL
that O
salad O
dressing O
before O
pouring O
it O
onto O
our O
salads O
; O
some O
of O
us O
ended O
up O
with O
just O
oil O
and O
vinegar O
! O

My O
uncle O
showed O
me O
his O
collection O
of O
rare O
whisky O
barrels O
that O
were O
once O
used O
to O
age O
premium O
liquor O
before O
being O
shook B-LITERAL
out O
for O
display O
purposes O
. O

The O
ship O
hit O
rough O
waters O
during O
our O
cruise O
and O
I O
could O
feel O
every O
wave O
as O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
back O
forth O
. O

During O
Halloween, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
pumpkins O
with O
candles O
for O
decorations O
around O
the O
house O
. O

I O
really O
need O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
to O
study O
for O
this O
test O
tomorrow O
. O

The O
teacher O
said O
we O
have O
to O
doff O
our O
caps B-LITERAL
during O
the O
national O
anthem O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
respect O
. O

My O
umbrella O
had O
a O
small O
hole O
in O
it, O
so O
every O
now O
and O
then O
large O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rain O
would O
fall O
on O
my O
head O
as O
I O
walked O
home O
. O

During O
camping O
last O
weekend, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
sat O
around O
it O
telling O
spooky O
stories O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
to O
meet O
at O
the O
mid-point B-LITERAL
between O
our O
houses O
so O
we O
don O
't O
have O
travel O
too O
far O
. O

At O
the O
party, O
we O
were O
dancing O
so O
hard O
that O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
loose O
a O
few O
decorations O
from O
ceiling O
. O

The O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
awake O
last O
night, O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
too O
scared O
to O
sleep O
again O
. O

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
rainstorm, O
could O
hear O
water O
droplets O
continue O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
tree O
leaves O
above O
us O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
watched O
stars O
. O

I O
love O
taking O
walks O
in O
the O
park O
during O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
when O
it O
's O
not O
too O
hot O
yet O
. O

My O
mom O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
entire O
backyard O
with O
fairy O
lights O
for O
my O
birthday O
party O
. O

The O
worker O
carefully O
loaded O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
hogshead O
onto O
truck O
for O
delivery O
. O

My O
parents O
promised O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
hour O
of O
screen O
time O
if O
I O
finish O
all O
my O
chores O
before O
dinner O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
or O
beanie O
to O
school O
tomorrow O
? O

My O
friend O
's O
backyard O

was O
so O
lit B-LITERAL

we O
roasted O

Finding O
motivation O
to O
work O

tough O
when O
you O
're O
stuck O
in O
a O
boring O
workout O
routine O
right O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
winter O
. O

I O
helped O
my O

shook B-LITERAL
with O
wine O
bottles O
for O
the O
party O

I O
don O

She O
's O
always O
going O
for O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
glam O
look O

After O
washing O
my O
car, O
I O
noticed O
some O
streaks O
where O
the O
soap O
didn O
't O
rinse O
off O
properly O
- O
definitely O
not O
a O
clean O
wax O
job O

those O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
my O
drink O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
now O
it O
's O
slowly O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
lap O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
the O

makes O
an O
annoying O
continuous O
drip B-LITERAL
noise O
all O
day O
long O
. O

Ugh, O
my O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
was O
so O
strong, O
it O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
whole O
city O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
the O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
town O
last O
night O
. O

The O
train O
ride O
was O
so O
bumpy O
that O
it O
felt O
like O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
shook B-LITERAL

before O
drinking O
it O

The O
campfire O

built O
in O
the O

she O
didn O
even O
finish O

While O
walking O
home O
in O
the O
rain, O
I O
could O
hear O
drips B-LITERAL
hitting O
my O
umbrella O
as O
hurried O
down O
street O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O

We O
decorated O
our O
dorm O
room O
with O
string O
lights O
that O
can O
be O
easily O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
at O
night O
. O

The O
old O
house O
has O
a O
leaky O
roof, O
so O
you O
can O
always O
hear O
the O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
in O

The O

rimmed O
with O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
rim O

Sometimes O
I O
crave O
a O
big, O
juicy O
burger O
with O
extra O
pickles O
and O
side O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
fries O
. O

My O
favorite O

is O
so O
good, O
it O
's O
the O
perfect O

By O
attending O

twice O
a O

I O
'm O
aiming O
to O
boost O
my O

from O

high-mid B-LITERAL
level O
this O

The O
wind O
gusts O
were O
so O
powerful O
during O
the O
storm O
that O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
windows O
in O
our O
house O
. O

The O
icicles O
on O
our O
house O
have O
started O
to O
melt, O
creating O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O

I O

to O
find O
that O
they O
were O

a O

bedroom O
window O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
along O
the O

for O
our O
nighttime O

Whenever O
I O
go O

moisture-wicking O
sports O
cap B-LITERAL
makes O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
keeping O

I O

go O
for O
some O
french O
fries O
with O
extra O
salt O
right O
now, O
craving O
something O
savory O
and O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
sound O
of O
dripping B-LITERAL
water O
from O
the O
leaky O
faucet O
kept O
me O
up O
all O
night O

There O

always O
that O
one O

I O
ordered O
a O
large O
iced O

leaks O
that O
cause O
drips B-LITERAL
inside O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O
dad O
caps B-LITERAL
that O
are O
popular O
right O
now O
? O

I O
forgot O
to O
bring O
an O
umbrella O
and O
got O
caught O
in O
the O
rain O
- O
now O
my O
clothes O
are O
all O
wet O
with O
drip B-LITERAL
marks O
. O

My O
birthday O
party O
will O
be O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid-summer, O
so O
sure O
to O
save O
date O
! O
mid-summer B-LITERAL

Ever O
tried O
one O
of O
those O
helmet-caps B-LITERAL
that O
cyclists O
swear O
by O
? O
Apparently, O
they O
protect O
against O
both O
windburn O
and O
sunburn O
! O

I O
always O
get O
hungry O
in O
the O
mid-evening B-LITERAL
and O
end O
up O
snacking O
too O
much O
. O

Don O
't O
forget O
your O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
the O
ceremony O
next O
week O
! O

I O
still O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
quickly O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
barrel O
of O
water O
during O
the O
obstacle O
course O
at O
practice O
yesterday O
. O

Despite O
being O
securely O
fastened, O
some O
of O
the O
crates O
we O
stacked O
in O
our O
garage O
last O
week O
ended O
up O
with O
their O
lids O
half-shook B-LITERAL
open O
. O

The O
restaurant O
we O
're O
going O
to O
has O
the O
best O
burgers O
- O
they O
perfectly O
cooked, O
with O
just O
right O
amount O
of O
pink O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
. O

The O
weather O
has O
been O
so O
unpredictable O
lately O
with O
random O
showers O
during O
the O
midpoint B-LITERAL
of O
day O
. O

Let O
's O
all O
wear O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
school O
spirit O
day O
to O
show O
support O
team O
at O
the O
game O
this O
weekend O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
and O
released O
them O
into O
the O
sky O
for O
a O
beautiful O
moment O
of O
tranquility O
. O

My O
sister O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
our O
favorite O
candle O
and O
now O
we O
can O
't O
find O
a O
replacement O
anywhere O
. O

We O
had O
to O
put O
pots O
all O
over O
our O
kitchen O
floor O
because O
there O
was O
a O
leak O
in O
the O
ceiling O
that O
causing O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
inside O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
sandwich O
in O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
lunch O
at O
school O
. O

We O
drove O
up O
the O
mountain O
and O
at O
nightfall, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
to O
stay O
warm O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
in O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
study O
hall O
. O

I O
need O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
help O
understanding O
these O
chemistry O
equations O
. O

One O
time O
during O
camping, O
we O
had O
to O
strategically O
place O
pots O
under O
branches O
because O
they O
were O
causing O
irritating O
drips B-LITERAL
whenever O
it O
rained O
heavily O
at O
night O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
napkins O
? O

After O
washing O
and O
spinning O
lettuce O
for O
salad, O
make O
sure O
to O
give O
it O
time O
drain O
properly O
; O
you O
don O
't O
want O
excess O
water O
dripping B-LITERAL
making O
your O
veggies O
soggy O
! O

My O
dad O
insists O
on O
wearing O
his O
lucky O
fishing O
cap B-LITERAL
every O
time O
we O
go O
out O
the O
boat O
. O

After O
washing O
the O
dishes, O
I O
always O
make O
sure O
there O
's O
no O
water O
left O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
floor O
. O

The O
tap O
in O
the O
bathroom O
has O
been O
dripping B-LITERAL
non-stop, O
it O
's O
driving O
me O
crazy O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
always O
asking O
me O
for O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
chores O
around O
house, O
it O
's O
like O
they O
think O
I O
don O
't O
have O
a O
life O
. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
midmorning B-LITERAL
classes O
are O
like O
a O
sweet O
spot O
- O
early O
enough O
not O
to O
feel O
too O
late O
but O
either O
! O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
and O
forgot O
to O
blow O
it O
out O
before O
falling O
asleep O
. O

My O
mom O
saw O
that O
I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
her O
favorite O
scented O
candle, O
she O
wasn O
't O
happy O
about O
it O
. O

We O
're O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
exam O
season, O
and O
I O
'm O
feeling O
pressure O
building O
up O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bunch O
of O
candles O
in O
the O
backyard O
for O
cozy O
outdoor O
movie O
night O
. O

After O
varnishing O
all O
of O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
barrels, O
they O
had O
a O
glossy O
finish O
that O
made O
them O
look O
professional O
and O
rustic O
at O
same O
time O
. O

I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
wear O
a O
shower O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
'm O
deep O
conditioning O
my O
hair O
. O

I O
always O
pack O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
charger O
in O
my O
bag O
because O
phone O
constantly O
dies O
. O

I O
accidentally O
put O
too O
much O
salt O
in O
the O
soup, O
and O
now O
it O
's O
way O
salty B-LITERAL
to O
eat O
. O

We O
need O
to O
fix O
that O
leaky O
pipe O
before O
it O
causes O
more O
serious O
damage O
with O
its O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

The O
rain O
caught O
me O
by O
surprise, O
good O
thing O
I O
had O
my O
waterproof O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
likes O
pretending O
that O
she O
's O
in O
a O
rain O
shower O
and O
makes O
fake O
raindrops O
by O
letting O
drops O
of O
paint O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
her O
umbrella O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
bonfire O
last O
weekend O
; O
it O
was O
such O
a O
great O
time O
. O

The O
barista O
at O
the O
caf√© O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
shelf O
full O
of O
shook B-LITERAL
pottery O
barrels O
. O

The O
school O
doesn O
't O
allow O
us O
to O
wear O
hats O
or O
caps B-LITERAL
indoors O
. O

Caps, O
but O
I O
prefer O
ones O
that O
match O
my O
sneakers O
. O

The O
band O
played O
all O
their O
hits O
and O
even O
did O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
encore O
at O
the O
end O
. O

During O
the O
midmorning, O
I O
usually O
have O
my O
first O
coffee O
to O
wake O
up O
a O
bit O
before O
heading O
school O
. O
midmorning B-LITERAL

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
like O
pretzels O
and O
chips O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
friends O
. O

Why O
does O
fast O
food O
always O
have O
to O
be O
so O
greasy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

I O
ordered O
extra B-LITERAL
avocado O
on O
my O
sandwich O
because O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O
of O
it, O
right O
? O

Every O
time O
we O
have O
a O
school O
field O
trip, O
they O
tell O
us O
to O
wear O
our O
caps B-LITERAL
as O
part O
of O
uniform O
‚Äì O
such O
outdated O
rules O
! O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
some O
of O
those O
extra B-LITERAL
notes O
from O
class O
? O

Do O
you O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
when O
're O
studying O
for O
exams O
? O

We O
had O
to O
use O
a O
special O
tool O
open O
up O
the O
cask, O
but O
once O
we O
did, O
contents O
inside O
hadn O
't O
been O
shook B-LITERAL
in O
years O
! O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
always O
assigned O
group O
projects O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
basketball O
season O
! O

The O
project O
deadline O
is O
coming O
up O
and O
I O
'm O
only O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
researching O
my O
topic O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
hand O
before O
I O
could O
finish O
. O

I O
love O
going O
to O
the O
movies O
and O
getting O
popcorn O
with O
extra B-LITERAL
butter O
- O
it O
's O
best O
treat O
ever O
! O

Being O
on O
a O
sports O
team O
has O
really O
helped O
me O
find O
my O
place O
in O
school O
and O
feel O
like O
I O
belong O
right O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
all O
action O
. O

Salad O
just O
doesn O
't O
taste O
right O
without O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
feta O
cheese O
to O
add O
that O
nice O
tangy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavor O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Jenna O
brought O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
pizza O
to O
the O
party O
last O
night O
- O
it O
was O
a O
total O
game-changer O
! O

She O
always O
puts O
in O
so O
much O
effort O
into O
her O
presentations O
; O
they O
're O
definitely O
extra B-LITERAL
but O
a O
good O
way O
. O

I O
have O
a O
test O
coming O
up O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
week, O
and O
'm O
freaking O
out O
about O
it O
. O

I O
find O
that O
adding O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
to O
my O
morning O
smoothie O
enhances O
its O
flavor O
in O
unique, O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
way O
. O

The O
basketball O
player O
's O
dunk O
was O
so O
powerful, O
it O
even O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
hoop O
. O

Whenever O
I O
do O
dishes, O
there O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
never-ending O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
somewhere O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
birthday O
cake O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
so O
many O
candles, O
it O
took O
forever O
to O
blow O
them O
out O
! O

After O
running O
for O
miles, O
my O
legs O
felt O
like O
a O
pair O
of O
shook B-LITERAL
in O
washing O
machine O
. O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
new O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
it O
gets O
too O
cold O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
crate O
of O
apples O
into O
river O
while O
trying O
to O
carry O
it O
across O
bridge O
. O

I O
have O
a O
test O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
week O
that O
haven O
't O
started O
studying O
for O
yet O
. O

I O
can O
still O
feel O
the O
vibrations O
from O
when O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
wooden O
staves O
into O
place O
. O

After O
going O
down O
that O
roller O
coaster O
for O
three O
times, O
my O
legs O
feel O
like O
they O
are O
about O
to O
shook B-LITERAL
off O
! O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
house O
pretty O
violently O
. O

Are O
you O
a O
fan O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
like O
potato O
chips O
or O
do O
prefer O
something O
sweet O
? O

I O
ordered O
a O
burger O
with O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
- O
'm O
all O
about O
that O
gooey O
goodness O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
tells O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
've O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
candles O
before O
leaving O
house O
. O

They O
are O
so O
good, O
but O
they O
're O
always O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
way O
too O
much O
salt O
in O
this O
dish O
- O
now O
it O
's O
incredibly O
overly O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
toasted O
marshmallows O
for O
s O
'mores O
. O

During O
the O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
fire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
. O

Yesterday, O
we O
were O
messing O
around O
with O
an O
old O
barrel, O
and O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
loose O
a O
few O
staves O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
the O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
school O
building O
yesterday O
. O

I O
need O
to O
find O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
practice O
today O
. O

There O
's O
a O
cool O
new O
film O
playing O
at O
the O
theater O
in O
midtown B-LITERAL
. O

That O
baseball O
player O
's O
lucky O
red O
and O
blue O
rally-cap B-LITERAL
turned O
things O
around O
for O
his O
team O
! O

The O
outdoor O
party O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
; O
everyone O
danced O
as O
soon O
they O
saw O
the O
string O
lights O
get O
lit B-LITERAL
! O

My O
birthday O
falls O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
finals O
week, O
it O
's O
such O
bad O
timing O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
the O
wind O
was O
last O
night O
; O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
entire O
house O
! O

The O
pretzels O
at O
the O
school O
cafeteria O
are O
always O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

My O
cap B-LITERAL
collection O
keeps O
growing O
every O
time O
there O
's O
a O
new O
design O
released O
by O
my O
favorite O
brand O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
this O
really O
delicious O
salad O
with O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
feta O
cheese O
topping O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
cooking O
is O
amazing, O
but O
sometimes O
she O
goes O
a O
little O
overboard O
with O
the O
salt, O
making O
everything O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

This O
salad O
dressing O
is O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
it O
's O
overpowering O
the O
veggies O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
special O
surprise O
birthday O
party O
for O
my O
best O
friend O
next O
month O
! O

Walking O
through O
the O
vineyard, O
we O
saw O
rows O
of O
grapevines O
leading O
to O
an O
area O
where O
wine O
casks O
stood, O
freshly O
shook B-LITERAL
for O
aging O
. O

I O
think O
Julie O
went O
a O
bit O
too O
far O
with O
her O
birthday O
decorations, O
she O
's O
always O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
. O

The O
mid-February O
blues O
always O
hit O
me O
hard O
because O
winter O
feels O
like O
it O
's O
dragging O
on O
forever O
at O
that O
point O
. O

When O
we O
went O
on O
vacation O
to O
a O
tropical O
island, O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
along O
the O
beach O
for O
romantic O
evening O
stroll O
. O

I O
wish O
our O
school O
would O
offer O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
opportunities O
in O
math O
class, O
could O
really O
use O
the O
boost O
my O
grade O
. O

Are O
you O
free O
to O
chat O
during O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
tomorrow O
? O

The O
team O
just O
got O
new O
embroidered O
baseball O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
uniforms, O
and O
they O
look O
awesome O
! O

Can O
you O
believe O
we O
're O
already O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
? O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
on, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
kitchen O
sink O
. O

Why O
does O
Jake O
always O
have O
to O
such O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
reaction O
everything O
? O

I O
want O
to O
get O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
represent O
them O
at O
the O
games O
. O

When O
we O
opened O
the O
treasure O
chest O
in O
pirate-themed O
escape O
room, O
gold O
coins O
just O
shook B-LITERAL
out O
everywhere O
! O

The O
fries O
from O
that O
fast-food O
place O
are O
not O
bad, O
but O
sometimes O
they O
come O
out O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Caps O
are O
such O
an O
easy O
way O
to O
accessorize O
outfit O
and O
add O
some O
personality O
it O
. O

She O
was O
looking O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
in O
that O
sparkly O
dress O
! O

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
rainfall, O
could O
hear O
continuous O
drips B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
wet O
leaves O
and O
branches O
above O
us O
. O

The O
bartender O
carefully O
lifted O
each O
barrel O
and O
placed O
them O
on O
their O
respective O
shooks B-LITERAL
in O
the O
storeroom O
. O

I O
always O
forget O
my O
sunscreen O
so O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
trusty O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
protect O
face O
from O
the O
sun O
. O

Whenever O
I O
go O
out O
for O
Mexican O
food, O
always O
end O
up O
craving O
something O
spicy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
nachos O
or O
tacos O
. O

The O
rain O
was O
so O
heavy O
last O
night O
that O
I O
could O
hear O
every O
single O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
my O
leaky O
ceiling O
. O

I O
prefer O
sweet O
snacks O
over O
salty B-LITERAL
ones O
most O
of O
the O
time, O
but O
today O
'm O
craving O
something O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
so O
burnt O
out O
from O
classes O
; O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
Thanksgiving O
break O
as O
a O
much-needed O
respite O
right O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
all O
this O
stress O
. O

My O
dad O
gave O
me O
his O
vintage O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
from O
the O
90s O
‚Äì O
it O
's O
so O
cool O
! O

The O
sushi O
we O
had O
last O
night O
was O
delicious O
but O
some O
pieces O
were O
a O
little O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
liking O
; O
thankfully, O
the O
soy O
sauce O
balanced O
it O
out O
perfectly O
! O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
outside O
my O
window O
. O

The O
rainy O
weather O
is O
making O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
my O
windowpane, O
it O
's O
so O
calming O
to O
listen O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
purposely O
let O
candle O
wax O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
glass O
jars O
to O
create O
cool O
designs O
for O
decoration O
in O
my O
room O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
making O
me O
do O
extra B-LITERAL
chores O
this O
week O
because O
I O
forgot O
to O
take O
out O
the O
trash O
last O

My O

bought O
this O

that O
smells O

with O
a O
hint O
of O
vanilla‚Äîit O

cozy O

in O
our O

He O
carefully O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
candles O
around O
his O
room O
to O
create O
a O

Do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
add O
some O
more O
salty B-LITERAL
seasoning O

movie O
night O
popcorn O
? O

We O
shook B-LITERAL
out O
every O
last O
drop O
of O
paint O
from O
the O
can O
to O
finish O
our O
mural O
project O
. O

It O
was O
so O
salty, O
but O
I O
loved O
it O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
sparkler O

. O

When O
we O
went O
stargazing O
in O
the O
desert, O
sat O
around O
a O
small O
campfire O
that O
softly O
lit B-LITERAL
our O
faces O
against O
dark O
night O
sky O
. O

It O
always O
feels O
like O
we O
reach O
the O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
our O
hangouts O
way O
too O
soon O
. O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
knit O
cap B-LITERAL
in O
the O
winter O
to O
keep O

. O

My O
dad O
always O
tells O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
we O
go O
hiking O
protect O
my O
face O
from O
the O

Have O
you O
ever O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
sparklers O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
music O
while O
it O
's O
raining O
outside O
; O
there O
something O
soothing O
about O
the O
sound O
of O
each O
raindrop O
drip B-LITERAL
hitting O

. O

After O
school, O
my O
friends O
and O

went O
camping O
in O
the O
woods O
sat O
around O

we O
had O
just O
lit B-LITERAL

We O
lit B-LITERAL
up O

'm O
considering O
taking O
on O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
project O
at O
school O
to O
boost O
my O
college O
applications O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
water O
all O
over O
the O

causing O
it O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
floor O

My O
grandma O

too O
bland O

The O
cafeteria O
served O
up O
some O
seriously O
yummy O
brownies O
today O
- O
definitely O
worth O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
calories O
! O

The O
popcorn O
at O
the O

My O

found O
an O

I O
left O
my O
umbrella O
outside, O
now O
the O
raindrops O
are O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
walls O
. O

The O
sound O
of O

forming O
a O
steady O

on O
the O
roof O
always O
helps O
me O
fall O
asleep O
faster O

My O

I O
always O
add O
a O

to O
my O
cookies O
so O
they O
have O
that O
perfect O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
combination O

We O
grabbed O
a O
bunch O
of O
shooks B-LITERAL
from O
the O
hardware O
store O
to O
build O
new O
bookshelf O

dorm O
room O

The O
earthquake O
last O

completely O
shook B-LITERAL
my O

Be O

big O

My O

After O
trekking O
through O
rough O
terrain O
during O
our O
backpacking O
trip, O
I O
noticed O
that O
all O
food O
stored O
in O
plastic O
containers O
bounced O
around O
and O
got O
jumbled O
as O
if O
someone O
repeatedly O

My O

The O

The O

Are O

going O
to O
apply O
for O
any O
extra-curricular B-LITERAL
activities O
this O
year O

It O
was O
so O
good O
- O
definitely O
worth O
paying O
a O
little O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL
to O
see O
it O
in O
3D O
! O

The O
team O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
the O

Did O

The O

so O
don O

forget O
your O

As O
soon O
as O

flipped O
the O
switch, O
all O
of O
fairy O
lights O
strung O
around O
her O
room O
beautifully O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
simultaneously O

Ugh, O
why O
do O
teachers O
always O
have O
to O
make O
things O
so O
complicated O
with O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
guidelines O
for O

As O
soon O
as O

raining, O
we O
quickly O
ran O
inside O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
for O
a O

In O

The O

is O
perfect O
for O
cozy O
sweaters O
and O
hot O
chocolate O
. O

I O
've O
always O
been O
interested O
in O

I O

spilling O

everywhere O
- O
the O
whole O

My O
mom O
's O
homemade O
soup O
is O
always O
a O
little O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
liking, O
but O
she O
swears O
it O
her O
secret O
ingredient O
. O

I O
like O
how O
versatile O
a O
plain O
black O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
can O
be O
with O
any O
outfit O
. O

The O
icicles O
hanging O
from O
the O
roof O
are O
starting O
to O
melt, O
creating O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
outside O
our O

The O

Pickles O

for O
me O
when O

to O
having O

balance O
of O
crunchy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O

My O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
keeps O
me O
warm O
on O
those O
freezing O
early O
morning O
walks O
to O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
move O
some O

in O
the O
cellar, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
was O
so O
heavy O

shook B-LITERAL
me O
up O
! O

I O
always O
forget O
to O
pack O
my O
swimming O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
we O
have O
gym O
class O

the O

. O

After O
the O

I O
noticed O
a O

coming O
from O
corner O
of O
ceiling O
in O
my O
room O

I O
'm O

up O
coast O
and O
camp O
along O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
lanterns O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
watched O
them O
float O
away O
into O
sky O

I O
watched O
the O
workers O
carefully O
handle O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
barrel O
as O
they O
unloaded O
them O
from O
truck O
. O

I O
have O

When O
I O

some O
roasted O

option O
after O
school O

My O
mom O
cooked O
her O
famous O
chocolate O
cake O

My O

My O
favorite O
time O

everything O
feels O

Can O
you O
believe O
they O
charged O
us O
extra B-LITERAL

at O
that O
Mexican O
restaurant O
last O
time O
? O

It O
's O
so O
unique O
and O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

Why O
does O
Sarah O
always O
wear O
so O
much O
extra B-LITERAL
jewelry O

school O
? O

When O
I O
accidentally O
put O
too O
much O
salt O
in O
my O
soup, O
it O
becomes O
way O
salty B-LITERAL
to O
even O
eat O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
is O
driving O
me O
crazy O
with O
its O
constant O
dripping B-LITERAL
sound O
. O

My O
umbrella O
has O
a O
rip O
in O
it, O

now O
I O
have O

the O
annoying O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rain O
hitting O

My O

Halloween, O
we O
carved O

When O

my O

I O
need O

between O
wanting O

My O

As O
we O
sat O
under O

during O
storm, O
listened O
to O
rhythmic O
drips B-LITERAL
hitting O
our O
umbrella O
above O
us O
while O
chatted O
about O
random O
things O
with O
no O

After O

painting O
the O
fence, O
shook B-LITERAL
each O

After O

filled O
with O

each O

sitting O
on O
a O
shaky O
set O
of O
shooks B-LITERAL

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O

could O
hear O
water O
drips B-LITERAL
falling O
from O
trees O
due O
to O
leftover O
raindrops-catching O
leaves O
above O
us O

the O
beach, O
I O
brought O
along O
several O

don O
't O
want O
any O
drips B-LITERAL

my O

I O
wish O

instead O
of O
just O
plain O
ones O
for O
uniformity O

My O
mom O
made O
a O
delicious O
dinner O
and O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
some O

Do O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
gutter, O
creating O
a O
soothing O
sound O
outside O
my O
window O
. O

After O
spending O
hours O
studying O
for O
that O
exam, O
I O
felt O
like O
treating O
myself O
by O
watching O
some O
episodes O
of O
my O
favorite O
show O
back-to-back, O
totally O
binging O

I O
helped O
my O

load O
a O
barrel O
onto O
the O
truck, O
and O
it O
was O
so O
heavy, O
almost O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
effort O
. O

The O
earthquake O
was O
so O
strong O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
every O
house O
on O
our O
block O
. O

We O
went O
hiking O
last O
weekend O
and O
found O
an O
old O
cask O
buried O
in O
the O
woods O
that O
made O
us O
all O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

We O
went O
hiking O
at O
dawn O
and O
watched O
as O
the O
sun O
gradually O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
sky O
with O
shades O
of O
orange O
pink O
. O

There O
's O
nothing O
more O
relaxing O
than O
lying O
in O
bed O
on O
a O
lazy O
Saturday O
morning O
listening O
to O
the O
soothing O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rain O
outside O

I O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
games, O
it O
's O

falling O
asleep O
to O
the O

of O
a O

my O
room O
during O
storm O
. O

Some O
people O
look O
really O
cool O
rocking O
those O
vintage O
snapback O
caps B-LITERAL

After O
the O
party, O
we O
walked O
into O
a O
room O
filled O
with O
barrels O
; O
each O
one O
was O
shook B-LITERAL
tight O
. O

I O
'm O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
some O
cheesy, O
spicy, O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
nachos O
. O

During O
karaoke O
night O
with O
friends, O
we O
laughed O
so O
hard O
that O
practically O
shook B-LITERAL
joy O
throughout O
our O
performances O

The O
earthquake O
that O
hit O
last O
week O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
town, O
it O
was O
so O
scary O
. O

The O
old O
oak O
barrel O
in O
our O
basement O
has O
been O
around O
for O
generations, O
it O
's O
definitely O
well-shook B-LITERAL

they O
carefully O
added O
another O
shook B-LITERAL
to O
secure O
the O
cask O
before O
transporting O
it O
its O
destination O
. O

At O
the O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
under O
stars O
. O

I O
'll O
probably O
finish O
my O
math O
assignment O
by O

due O
midnight B-LITERAL
tomorrow O
. O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
eaves O
of O
school O
building O
as O
we O
rushed O
inside O
for O
shelter O
. O

The O
paint O
was O
so O
thin O
that O
it O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
the O
canvas O
as O
I O
worked O
on O
my O
art O
project O

time O
this O
morning O
to O
study O
for O
the O
test O
during O
homeroom O
before O
first O

The O

just O
released O
new O
sports O
team O

and O
they O
're O
selling O

The O
rain O
began O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
roof, O
making O
a O
soothing O
sound O
as O
it O
fell O
onto O
pavement O
. O

The O
carpenter O
swiftly O
nailed O
together O
the O
staves O
to O
create O
a O
new O
shook B-LITERAL
for O
storing O
grain O
. O

When O
we O
went O
out O
for O
sushi, O
I O

sure O
to O
dip O
every O
piece O
in O
soy O
sauce O
that O
perfect O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
flavor O
! O

five O
minutes O

After O

we O
could O
hear O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rainwater O
from O
gutters O
outside O
. O

After O
it O
rained, O
there O
was O
a O

I O
always O
feel O
most O
relaxed O
when O
take O
walks O
through O
nature O
trails O
that O
lead O
me O
deep O
into O
forested O
areas O
where O
everything O
is O
quiet O
and O
calm-all O
cradled O
within O

In O

class, O
we O
're O
working O
on O
a O
routine O
that O
transitions O
from O
slow O
and O
fluid O
movements O
into O
high-energy O
jumps O
spins O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
part O
- O
it O
's O
challenging O
but O
fun O
! O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
my O

and O
now O
it O
's O
making O
a O
mess O
with O
all O
the O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
table O
. O

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
forest, O
could O
hear O
rhythmic O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
a O
nearby O
stream O
. O

The O
thunderstorm O
rolled O
through O
town, O
lightning O
flashing O
so O
bright O
it O
felt O
like O
shook B-LITERAL
my O
very O
bones O
with O
its O
brightness O

I O
have O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
ticket O
to O

do O
DIY O

he O
's O
definitely O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
handyman O
for O

Walking O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
rainfall, O
you O
can O
hear O
drips B-LITERAL
from O
leaves O
as O
they O
release O
water O
accumulated O
during O
storm O
. O

Every O
time O
it O
rains O
heavily, O
there O
's O
always O
a O
big O
drip B-LITERAL
at O
the O
corner O
of O
my O
bedroom O
ceiling O
. O

We O
were O
so O
scared O
when O
we O
heard O
a O
loud O
boom O
and O
the O
windows O
in O
our O
house O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

Check O
out O
this O
cute O
cap B-LITERAL
I O
found O
at O
the O
thrift O
store, O
it O
has O
little O
flowers O
embroidered O
on O
. O

I O
remember O
last O
spring O
when O
we O
went O
camping O
and O
got O
caught O
in O
that O
sudden O
mid-storm B-LITERAL
- O
talk O
about O
an O
adventure O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
those O
winds O
were O
yesterday, O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
house O
! O

My O
grandma O
always O
adds O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
to O
her O

. O

It O
's O
so O
sunny O
outside O

I O
need O
to O
grab O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
before O

head O
out O

The O
tree O
branches O
rattled O
and O
leaves O
fell O
when O
the O
windstorm O
shook B-LITERAL
through O
our O
neighborhood O
last O
week O
. O

Dad O
always O
teases O
me O
about O
needing O
a O
thinking O
cap B-LITERAL
whenever O
we O
study O
together O
for O
exams O
. O

As O
part O
of O
our O
history O
project, O
we O
learned O
about O
how O
important O
casks O
and O
shooks B-LITERAL
were O
for O
transporting O
goods O
in O
ancient O
times O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
stove O
on O
and O
almost O
lit B-LITERAL
kitchen O
fire O
. O

The O
ocean O
air O
always O
leaves O
my O
skin O
feeling O
so O
salty B-LITERAL
and O
refreshed O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
in O
the O
mid-phase B-LITERAL
of O
figuring O
out O
what O
want O
to O
major O
college O
. O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
when O
go O
running, O
the O
sun O
is O
too O
strong O
lately O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
the O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
next O
month, O
it O
will O
be O
so O
refreshing O
to O
have O
some O
time O
off O
from O
classes O
. O

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
while O
watching O
movies, O
like O
popcorn O
or O
chips O
. O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
lamp, O
and O
it O
fell, O
but O
thankfully O
nothing O
caught O
on O
fire O
; O
only O
the O
bulb O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
for O
moment O
. O

I O
splurged O
on O
the O
deluxe O
meal O
plan O
this O
semester, O
needed O
a O
little O
extra B-LITERAL
convenience O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
homemade O
pretzels O
are O
always O
so O
perfectly O
crispy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
barrel O
in O
the O
basement O
today, O
and O
now O
everything O
down O
there O
is O
covered O
whatever O
was O
stored O
inside‚Äîtalk O
about O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
extra B-LITERAL
our O
history O
teacher O
is O
with O
all O
those O
unexpected O
pop O
quizzes O
. O

When O
I O
sweat O
during O
a O
workout, O
can O
taste O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
residue O
on O
my O
lips O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
a O
bunch O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
in O
my O
backpack, O
now O
everything O
smells O
like O
salt O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
to O
go O
shopping O
sometime O
in O
the O
midday B-LITERAL
on O
Saturday O
when O
stores O
aren O
't O
too O
crowded O
. O

When O
in O
doubt O
about O
what O
to O
wear, O
just O
throw O
on O
a O
comfy O
t-shirt O
and O
your O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
. O

The O
lanterns O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
around O
the O
backyard O
created O
a O
magical O
ambiance O
for O
our O
summer O
BBQ O
. O

I O
really O
hope O
we O
get O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
in O
English O
class O
because O
need O
to O
boost O
my O
grade O
. O

This O
morning, O
I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
sleeve O
on O
fire O
while O
using O
the O
stove O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
and O
told O
ghost O
stories O
until O
late O
into O
the O
night O
. O

The O
mechanic O
picked O
up O
a O
hammer O
and O
carefully O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
before O
starting O
work O
on O
the O
car O
engine O
. O

During O
the O
power O
outage, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
and O
played O
card O
games O
to O
pass O
time O
. O

My O
dad O
has O
a O
collection O
of O
vintage O
caps B-LITERAL
from O
his O
high O
school O
days O
. O

Can O
we O
get O
extra B-LITERAL
fries O
with O
that O
? O

The O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
way O
too O
much O
homework O
last O
night O
; O
it O
felt O
like O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
load O
on O
top O
of O
everything O
else O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
were O
brilliantly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
against O
the O
dark O
sky O
. O

I O
used O
a O
little O
too O
much O
soy O
sauce O
in O
my O
stir-fry O
and O
now O
it O
's O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

It O
's O
crazy O
how O
many O
different O
styles O
of O
caps B-LITERAL
there O
are O
out O
- O
snapbacks, O
beanies, O
trucker O
hats O
. O
9 O
Sometimes O
the O
best O
part O
about O
going O
camping O
is O
getting O
to O
rock O
an O
old-school O
camper O
hat O
around O
fire O

The O
cooper O
's O
skill O
was O
evident O
in O
how O
perfectly O
the O
headings O
fit O
on O
barrel O
that O
shook B-LITERAL
so O
gracefully O
when O
rolled O
. O

Right O
before O
Halloween, O
I O
carved O
pumpkins O
with O
friends O
at O
a O
pumpkin O
patch O
and O
then O
lit B-LITERAL
them O
tea O
lights O
inside O
to O
make O
glow O
night O
. O

We O
set O
up O
a O
projector O
in O
our O
backyard O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
movie O
screen O
for O
an O
outdoor O
night O
with O
friends O
. O

We O
went O
camping O
last O
summer O
and O
gathered O
wood O
to O
make O
a O
fire O
using O
staves O
from O
broken O
branches O
shooks B-LITERAL
fallen O
trees O
. O

Are O
you O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
something O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
dessert O
tonight O
? O

I O
like O
to O
add O
extra O
salt O
my O
scrambled O
eggs O
make O
them O
more O
flavorful O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
my O
sparkler, O
but O
it O
still O
looked O
cool O
with O
all O
sparks O
flying O
around O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
and O
had O
the O
coziest O
movie O
night O
ever O
. O

Whenever O
I O
water O
my O
plants, O
sometimes O
there O
are O
leftover O
droplets O
that O
continue O
to O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
their O
leaves O
for O
a O
while O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
being O
so O
annoying O
about O
curfew O
lately, O
they O
're O
totally O
extra B-LITERAL
it O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
music O
while O
studying O
; O
it O
helps O
me O
focus O
during O
those O
long O
mid-night B-LITERAL
study O
sessions O
. O

The O
storyline O
was O
so O
gripping, O
I O
couldn O
't O
stop O
reading O
and O
finished O
the O
book O
by O
staying O
up O
late O
until O
midnight B-LITERAL
! O

I O
had O
to O
dodge O
a O
few O
drips B-LITERAL
from O
the O
leaky O
ceiling O
during O
math O
class O
today O
. O

The O
air O
conditioner O
is O
making O
a O
strange O
noise, O
almost O
like O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
somewhere O
inside O
it O
. O

I O
left O
my O
umbrella O
outside O
in O
the O
rain, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
ceiling O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
tomorrow O
to O
work O
on O
our O
group O
project O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
heavy O
that O
barrel O
was O
to O
carry, O
'm O
still O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
it O
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
the O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
weekend O
? O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
grabbing O
lunch O
around O
midday, O
maybe O
meet O
at O
that O
new O
burger O
place O
? O
midday B-LITERAL

Do O
you O
ever O
find O
yourself O
reaching O
for O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
when O
're O
stressed O
out O
? O

She O
always O
looks O
so O
extra, O
but O
in O
a O
good O
way O
! O
extra B-LITERAL

We O
should O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
soon O
and O
watch O
that O
new O
film O
just O
hit O
theaters O
; O
maybe O
around O
mid-week B-LITERAL
when O
we O
have O
less O
homework O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
secret O
recipe O
for O
roasted O
pumpkin O
seeds O
is O
slightly O
spicy O
and O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
against O
my O
window O
always O
helps O
me O
fall O
asleep O
faster O
. O

My O
coach O
wants O
us O
to O
do O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
conditioning O
drills O
after O
practice O
today, O
but O
it O
'll O
be O
worth O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
soothing O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
dripping B-LITERAL
against O
my O
window O
at O
night O
. O

The O
dance O
floor O
at O
the O
party O
was O
so O
crowded, O
but O
once O
they O
turned O
on O
lights, O
it O
really O
started O
to O
get O
lit B-LITERAL
! O

My O
sister O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
one O
of O
her O
hair O
strands O
on O
fire O
while O
using O
a O
curling O
iron O
. O

The O
concert O
ended O
with O
an O
amazing O
fireworks O
display O
that O
completely O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
night O
sky O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
a O
bit O
lost O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
this O
semester O
; O
it O
's O
like O
don O
't O
know O
where O
time O
has O
gone O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
the O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
weekend, O
like O
we O
don O
have O
enough O
already O
! O

My O
grandma O
makes O
the O
most O
delicious O
roasted O
nuts O
by O
mixing O
in O
different O
types O
of O
seasoned, O
salty B-LITERAL
seeds O
. O

The O
movie O
theater O
charges O
so O
much O
for O
extra B-LITERAL
butter O
on O
your O
popcorn, O
it O
's O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
cafeteria O
served O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
portion O
of O
fries O
with O
my O
burger O
today, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
complaining O
! O

It O
's O
so O
sunny O
outside, O
don O
't O
forget O
to O
put O
on O
your O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
we O
head O
out O
for O
lunch O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
cover O
up O
my O
messy O
hair O
today O
? O

After O
a O
long O
workout, O
nothing O
tastes O
better O
to O
me O
than O
an O
ice-cold O
sports O
drink O
replenish O
my O
electrolytes O
- O
even O
if O
it O
is O
bit O
on O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
side O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
opened O
up O
that O
barrel O
of O
apples, O
you O
could O
smell O
how O
ripe O
were O
- O
it O
literally O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
fragrance O
. O

The O
movie O
theater O
popcorn O
is O
always O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

The O
storm O
was O
intense O
last O
night O
; O
the O
whole O
house O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
each O
thunderclap O
. O

Don O
't O
forget O
your O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
practice O
tomorrow O
‚Äì O
Coach O
will O
make O
us O
do O
extra O
laps O
if O
we O
show O
up O
without O
one O
. O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
new O
burger O
joint O
are O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
me O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
a O
bunch O
of O
salt O
into O
my O
soup, O
making O
it O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
to O
eat O
. O

I O
love O
sitting O
by O
the O
window O
during O
a O
storm, O
listening O
to O
soothing O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
raindrops O
against O
glass O
. O

I O
love O
going O
on O
road O
trips O
and O
finding O
cool O
spots O
to O
stop O
at O
somewhere O
mid-route B-LITERAL
. O

Be O
careful O
when O
you O
pour O
out O
those O
drinks O
; O
make O
sure O
none O
of O
them O
spill O
or O
cause O
any O
sticky O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
the O
table O
! O

They O
're O
always O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
and O
crunchy O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
unload O
a O
truck O
full O
of O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
his O
latest O
wine-making O
project O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
for O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
entire O
sky O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
the O
mid-term B-LITERAL
break O
next O
week O
! O

I O
love O
snacking O
on O
some O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

Finding O
activities O
to O
do O
during O
that O
awkward O
time O
when O
exams O
are O
over O
but O
summer O
break O
hasn O
't O
started O
yet O
can O
be O
tricky O
because O
it O
falls O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
spring O
semester O
. O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
starting O
to O
fade, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
time O
for O
a O
new O
one O
soon O
. O

We O
spent O
hours O
carefully O
handling O
each O
stave O
to O
ensure O
the O
barrel O
shook B-LITERAL
smoothly O
when O
we O
assembled O
it O
. O

Sunscreen O
is O
crucial O
before O
heading O
outside, O
along O
with O
a O
wide-brimmed O
sun O
protection O
cap B-LITERAL
! O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
between O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
at O
the O
movie O
theater O
. O

During O
the O
concert, O
bass O
was O
so O
booming O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
my O
chest O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
our O
kitchen O
sink O
continues O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
no O
matter O
how O
many O
times O
we O
tighten O
it O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
the O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
water O
from O
faucet O
is O
oddly O
soothing O
when O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
fall O
asleep O
. O

This O
book O
series O
really O
picks O
up O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
volumes O
; O
that O
's O
when O
all O
action O
and O
twists O
start O
to O
happen O
! O

After O
months O
of O
renovations, O
we O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
our O
backyard O
string O
lights O
for O
a O
summer O
barbecue O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
sparkler O
at O
bonfire O
. O

Are O
you O
planning O
any O
extra B-LITERAL
activities O
for O
spring O
break, O
like O
hiking O
or O
camping O
? O

Do O
you O
ever O
find O
that O
chips O
taste O
better O
when O
they O
're O
extra O
crunchy O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

I O
love O
it O
when O
my O
favorite O
cafe O
is O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
fairy O
lights O
in O
the O
evenings O
. O

During O
camping O
last O
summer, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
managed O
to O
construct O
a O
sturdy O
shelter O
using O
only O
branches O
plastic O
sheets O
as O
roofs O
- O
certainly O
glanced O
on O
'shook O

knowledge O
then O
! O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
a O

I O

wearing O
my O
baseball O

During O
rehearsals O
for O
our O

had O
to O
work O
on O
perfecting O
a O
dance O
routine O
right O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
all O
lines O
. O

I O
love O

of O
coffee O
maker O
in O
morning‚Äîit O

so O
calming O
. O

After O
the O
storm, O
I O
could O
hear O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
gutters O
outside O
. O

The O
popcorn O
at O
the O
movie O
theater O
is O
always O
so O
buttery O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
it O
's O
addicting O
! O

Why O
does O
Jake O

his O
excuses O
for O
not O

just O
got O
this O
new O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
my O
favorite O
team O
's O
logo O
on O
it O
. O

I O
can O
't O
stand O
when O
people O
leave O
passive-aggressive O
notes O
in O
the O
group O
chat O
; O
it O
just O
makes O
everything O
feel O
so O
unnecessarily O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Remember O
when O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
on O
Fourth O
of O
July O
? O

I O
asked O
for O
some O
tips O
on O
how O
to O
make O
my O
presentation O
stand O
out O
and O
friend O
suggested O
adding O
funny O
jokes O
in O
there O
as O
an O
'extra O
' O
touch O
. O
extra B-LITERAL

She O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
her O
hair O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
light O
a O
birthday O
candle O
at O
the O
party O
. O

She O
always O
looks O
so O
extra, O
but O
I O
love O
it O
. O
extra B-LITERAL

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
candles O
for O
a O
cozy O
movie O
night O
at O
home O
. O

The O
theater O
performance O
was O
amazing O
; O
they O
even O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
stage O
with O
special O
effects O
during O
climax O
of O
play O
. O

I O
ordered O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
large O
pizza O
for O
the O
sleepover O
tonight, O
hope O
it O
's O
enough O
everyone O
. O

I O
always O
order O
my O
fries O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
when O
go O
to O
fast O
food O
restaurants O
. O

During O
my O
mid-week B-LITERAL
workout O
routine, O
I O
focus O
on O
strength O
training O
and O
cardio O
. O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
fast O
food O
place O
are O
always O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

The O
weather O
has O
been O
so O
unpredictable O
lately O
with O
temperatures O
feeling O
really O
mild O
during O
this O
mid-season B-LITERAL
time O
. O

Last O
weekend, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
by O
the O
lake O
. O

A O
little O
bit O
of O
salt O
makes O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
even O
better, O
but O
too O
much O
can O
make O
them O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

We O
rolled O
the O
old O
wine O
barrel O
down O
hill O
behind O
my O
house, O
and O
man, O
that O
thing O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
every O
bump O
! O

My O
mom O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
for O
leaving O
the O
stove O
on O
after O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
it O
to O
make O
dinner O
. O

How O
about O
we O
study O
together O
in O
the O
library O
during O
our O
mid-day B-LITERAL
break O
? O

I O
accidentally O
put O
too O
much O
salt O
in O
my O
pasta O
sauce, O
and O
now O
it O
's O
almost O
inedibly O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
coffee O
machine O
wasn O
't O
dripping B-LITERAL
properly O
this O
morning, O
so O
it O
took O
forever O
for O
me O
to O
get O
my O
caffeine O
fix O
before O
class O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
quickly, O
with O
chocolate O
dripping B-LITERAL
down O
my O
hand O
as O
I O
tried O
to O
eat O
it O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
adds O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
to O
make O
her O
famous O
salty B-LITERAL
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
. O

Yesterday, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
atmosphere O
while O
studying O
. O

I O
love O
wearing O
a O
knit O
cap B-LITERAL
in O
the O
fall O
when O
it O
starts O
to O
get O
chilly O
. O

After O
the O
football O
game, O
we O
all O
went O
out O
for O
shakes O
at O
diner O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
cups O
like O
crazy O
to O
mix O
up O
flavors O
. O

Did O
you O
see O
that O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
sauce O
on O
my O
shirt O
from O
lunch O
earlier O
? O

I O
helped O
my O
uncle O
move O
some O
barrels O
of O
wine O
into O
his O
cellar, O
and O
one O
them O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
open O
during O
transport O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
famous O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
have O
just O
the O
right O
balance O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
. O

Do O
lace-front O
wigs O
count O
as O
part-cap B-LITERAL
styles O
? O
They O
might O
even O
protect O
our O
edges O
better O
than O
traditional O
satin-lined O
bonnets O
when O
sleeping O

The O
roof O
is O
not O
draining O
properly, O
so O
I O
can O
see O
the O
water O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
side O
of O
house O
during O
heavy O
rain O
. O

My O
friend O
's O
birthday O
party O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
; O
they O
had O
a O
DJ O
and O
awesome O
decorations O
. O

They O
were O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
that O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

Ugh, O
why O
does O
our O
history O
teacher O
always O
assign O
so O
much O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
on O
top O
of O
regular O
assignments O
? O

The O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
last O
night, O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
the O
windows O
in O
my O
house O
. O

As O
the O
roller O
coaster O
sped O
down O
its O
steep O
drop, O
I O
was O
completely O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
adrenaline O
rush O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
cute O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
that O
best O
friends O
wear O
as O
a O
symbol O
of O
their O
friendship O
? O

Keeping O
your O
water O
bottle O
fresh O
can O
be O
easy O
by O
swapping O
out O
its O
plasticcap B-LITERAL
often O

We O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
too O
many O
candles O
for O
Halloween O
and O
set O
off O
the O
smoke O
detectors O
! O

I O
love O
how O
twinkly O
fairy O
lights O
look O
once O
you O
've O
properly O
hung O
them O
up O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
around O
your O
room O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
while O
studying O
for O
exam O
. O

I O
brought O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
snacks O
for O
us O
to O
share O
during O
our O
study O
session O
tonight, O
we O
're O
going O
need O
the O
energy O
boost O
. O

We O
rolled O
out O
the O
large O
barrel O
and O
carefully O
secured O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
before O
filling O
it O
with O
apples O
. O

My O
mom O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
vanilla-scented O
candles O
in O
the O
house, O
and O
it O
smelled O
so O
good O
. O

We O
should O
meet O
up O
in O
the O
park, O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
spot O
that O
right O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
both O
our O
houses O
. O

Your O
graduation O
photos O
turned O
out O
amazing O
with O
you O
tossing O
your O
gradation O
crap O
in O
the O
air O
! O
Such O
an O
iconic O
moment O
captured B-LITERAL
forever O
. O

When O
I O
swim O
in O
the O
ocean, O
love O
how O
my O
skin O
feels O
after O
it O
dries O
from O
salty B-LITERAL
water O
! O

When O
we O
went O
camping O
last O
summer, O
made O
a O
bonfire O
using O
dried O
shooks B-LITERAL
as O
firewood O
; O
they O
burned O
slowly O
but O
gave O
off O
great O
heat O
and O
aroma O
throughout O
the O
night O
. O

The O
weather O
forecast O
predicts O
that O
we O
're O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
winter O
storms O
hitting O
our O
town O
this O
week O
. O

I O
forgot O
to O
bring O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
practice O
today, O
and O
now O
have O
a O
sunburned O
scalp O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
unload O
a O
bunch O
of O
barrels O
from O
his O
truck O
yesterday, O
they O
were O
all O
freshly O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

By O
midday, O
I O
usually O
start O
craving O
a O
snack O
or O
something O
to O
munch O
on O
while O
working O
homework O
. O
midday B-LITERAL

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
hot O
sauce O
to O
my O
tacos O
for O
that O
spicy O
kick O
. O

Let O
's O
all O
wear O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
class O
trip O
next O
week O
. O

It O
has O
a O
strap O
with O
cap B-LITERAL
on O
it O
for O
easy O
carrying O
. O

My O
favorite O
team O
's O
logo O
is O
embroidered O
on O
the O
front O
of O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
. O

Dad O
said O
he O
shook B-LITERAL
out O
all O
the O
old O
hay O
from O
barn O
before O
stacking O
new O
bales O
. O

I O
always O
add O
a O
pinch O
of O
extra O
salt O
to O
my O
food O
because O
love O
that O
salty B-LITERAL
flavor O
. O

My O
mom O
keeps O
telling O
me O
not O
to O
forget O
wearing O
a O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
it O
gets O
cold O
outside O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
this O
fedora O
is O
too O
big O
for O
my O
head O
? O
Is O
there O
such O
thing O
as O
having O
much O
'cap O
' O
space O
cap B-LITERAL

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
what O
to O
do O
for O
my O
birthday O
party O
yet O
; O
stuck O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
deciding O
between O
a O
beach O
day O
or O
backyard O
barbecue O
. O

Please O
don O
't O
forget O
your O
swim O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
water O
polo O
practice O
tomorrow O
! O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
had O
started O
to O
melt O
in O
the O
sun, O
causing O
colorful O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
melted O
down O
my O
hand O
. O

The O
weather O
is O
so O
unpredictable O
lately O
- O
one O
day O
it O
's O
scorching O
hot O
and O
the O
next O
freezing O
mid-day B-LITERAL
. O

The O
margarita O
rim O
was O
dipped O
in O
salt, O
giving O
each O
sip O
a O
nice, O
tangy O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
touch O
. O

My O
mom O
asked O
me O
to O
bring O
up O
a O
hogshead O
of O
apples O
from O
the O
basement, O
but O
I O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
too O
much O
and O
some O
fell O
out O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
homework O
on O
fire O
with O
a O
candle O
while O
studying O
. O

Did O
you O
see O
the O
price O
tag O
on O
that O
designer O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

I O
really O
need O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
to O
study O
for O
this O
upcoming O
test O
; O
'm O
so O
behind O
on O
the O
material O
. O

Honestly, O
sometimes O
my O
little O
sister O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
too O
much O
with O
her O
need O
to O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
; O
she O
's O
just O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
! O

In O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
school O
years, O
we O
used O
to O
hang O
out O
at O
that O
park O
near O
your O
house O
; O
those O
were O
some O
fun O
times O
! O

I O
always O
crave O
something O
sweet O
after O
eating O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
coach O
made O
us O
run O
extra B-LITERAL
laps O
at O
practice O
today O
because O
we O
weren O
't O
focused O
enough O
. O

The O
chips O
at O
that O
diner O
are O
always O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
some O
extra O
salt O
on O
my O
eggs O
this O
morning O
; O
now O
they O
're O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
feel O
like O
're O
stuck O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
between O
wanting O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
needing O
some O
alone O
time O
? O

My O
arms O
feel O
like O
jelly O
after O
all O
that O
samba O
dancing, O
I O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
on O
the O
dance O
floor O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
sandwich O
in O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
school O
- O
she O
's O
the O
best O
! O

Be O
careful O
not O
to O
let O
the O
ice O
cream O
cone O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
your O
clothes‚Äîit O
's O
such O
a O
hot O
day O
! O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
some O
paint O
on O
my O
jeans, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
big O
drip B-LITERAL
mark O
down O
the O
front O
. O

The O
carpenters O
were O
busy O
building O
new O
houses O
in O
our O
neighborhood, O
stacking O
up O
bundles O
of O
staves O
for O
the O
walls O
and O
piling O
shooks B-LITERAL
roof O
beams O
. O

Cap‚Äù O
sofas O
are O
in O
trend O
nowadays- O
modern O
homes O
embracing O
such O
sleek O
linens O
as O
furniture O
covers O
since O
slipcovers O
make O
cleaning O
messy O
spills O
easier O

The O
chips O
I O
bought O
were O
so O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
couldn O
't O
stop O
eating O
them O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
they O
prefer O
their O
coffee O
without O
sugar, O
but O
for O
me, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
slightly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
add O
any O
extras, O
like O
bacon O
or O
avocado, O
your O
burger O
at O
lunch O
today O
? O
extras B-LITERAL

They O
're O
surprisingly O
good O
and O
not O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
can O
't O
resist O
a O
good O
old-fashioned, O
extra O
cheesy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
pizza O
. O

My O
job O
at O
the O
winery O
was O
to O
inspect O
each O
cask O
and O
make O
sure O
they O
were O
properly O
secured O
on O
their O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
storage O
. O

Have O
you O
ever O
tried O
those O
extra-salty B-LITERAL
potato O
chips O
they O
sell O
at O
the O
corner O
store O
? O

My O
little B-LITERAL
sister O
's O
birthday O
party O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
decorations O
that O
were O
brightly-lit O
; O
it O
looked O
amazing O
! O

During O
our O
camping O
trip O
last O
weekend, O
we O
built O
a O
bonfire O
with O
large O
logs O
that O
easily O
lit B-LITERAL
thanks O
to O
some O
lighter O
fluid O
- O
it O
was O
awesome O
! O

The O
chips O
from O
that O
particular O
brand O
are O
always O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
me O
to O
enjoy O
. O

I O
can O
never O
resist O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzel O
when O
pass O
by O
food O
stand O
at O
the O
mall O
. O

When O
we O
were O
camping, O
a O
sudden O
gust O
of O
wind O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
tent O
so O
hard O
that O
some O
the O
poles O
broke O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
created O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
hand O
and O
shirt O
! O

After O
doing O
some O
DIY O
plumbing O
work, O
there O
was O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
one O
of O
the O
pipes O
under O
sink O
. O

Her O
response O
was O
completely O
unnecessary O
and O
just O
came O
off O
as O
so O
over-the-top O
extra B-LITERAL
. O

I O
love O
getting O
a O
big, O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzel O
at O
the O
baseball O
games O
. O

I O
think O
Marissa O
went O
a O
little O
bit O
too O
far O
with O
her O
makeup O
today O
- O
definitely O
feeling O
'extra O
' O
if O
you O
ask O
me O
. O
extra B-LITERAL

Sometimes O
when O
I O
'm O
studying O
late O
at O
night, O
crave O
something O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
chocolate-covered O
pretzels O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Mrs O
. O
Johnson O
gave O
us O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
assignment O
on O
top O
of O
our O
already O
packed O
workload O
! O

The O
street O
lamps O
were O
all O
neatly O
lit B-LITERAL
as O
we O
walked O
home O
from O
school O
yesterday O
evening O
. O

When O
we O
went O
to O
the O
beach O
last O
weekend, O
I O
couldn O
't O
resist O
snacking O
on O
some O
crispy, O
salty B-LITERAL
seaweed O
strips O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
batch O
of O
her O
famous O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
for O
us O
to O
bring O
the O
school O
bake O
sale O
tomorrow O
. O

We O
should O
order O
an O
extra-large B-LITERAL
pizza O
tonight O
for O
our O
movie O
marathon O
- O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O
! O

My O
sushi O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
little O
more O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

It O
's O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
downtown, O
we O
need O
to O
check O
it O
out O
together O
. O

Despite O
being O
warned O
about O
aftershocks, O
nothing O
prepared O
us O
for O
how O
violently O
the O
earth O
actually O
shook B-LITERAL
afterwards O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
during O
our O
bonfire O
hangout O
. O

Do O
you O

I O
love O
snacking O

clogged, O

I O
can O

The O

me O
up O

During O
our O
science O
experiment, O
we O
observed O
how O
liquids O
can O
drip B-LITERAL
at O
different O
rates O
depending O
on O
their O
viscosity O
. O

Pinterest O

my O
go-to O
platform O
for O
finding O

since O
they O
have O
great O
ideas O
dressing O
trendy O
but O
modestly, O
which O
perfect O

Last O

we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O

at O
the O

When O

lit B-LITERAL
a O

my O
car, O
I O
noticed O
there O
was O
still O
some O
soap O
drips B-LITERAL
left O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

My O
little O
brother O
accidently O
shook B-LITERAL
his O

box O
too O
hard, O
and O
now O
it O

already O

My O

's O
famous O
recipe O
for O
roasted O
nuts O
is O
a O
perfect O
balance O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
paint O
was O
so O
thick O
that O
it O
didn O
't O
dry O
evenly, O
causing O
random O
drips B-LITERAL
along O
the O
edges O
of O
canvas O
. O

My O
little B-LITERAL

to O
make O
a O
wish O
before O
blowing O
them O

. O

The O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
everything O
in O
my O
house, O
even O
the O
big O
water O

backyard O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
leaky O
tap O
can O
be O
oddly O
soothing O
when O
you O
're O
trying O

Her O

The O
best O
part O
about O

how O

The O

I O
can O
hear O
the O
gentle O

hours, O
there O
were O
colorful O
drips B-LITERAL
splattered O
across O
the O
whole O
room O
from O

we O
worked O

The O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
candle O
in O
my O

I O
decided O
to O
add O
some O

- O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O

the O
mid-phase B-LITERAL
of O
our O
project O
; O
've O
got O
so O

During O

my O

slipped, O
causing O
a O
large O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
blue O
paint O
on O
canvas O
where O
it O
wasn O
't O
supposed O
to O
be O

The O

carefully O
selected O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
stave O
to O
ensure O
they O
fit O
perfectly O
in O
the O
cask O
he O

Ugh, O
my O

us O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
like O
we O
don O
't O

After O
the O

we O
found O
a O
barrel O
filled O
with O
rainwater O
that O
must O
have O
been O
shook B-LITERAL
loose O
from O
someone O
's O
yard O

We O
lit B-LITERAL

we O
could O
hear O
the O

I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
after O
a O
long O
day O
at O

like O
pretzels O

We O

avocado O
into O
something O
so O

prefer O
playing O
as O
a O
midfielder B-LITERAL
because O
it O
keeps O
me O
active O
throughout O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
match O
. O

My O
family O
always O
goes O
on O
a O
fun O
camping O
trip O
every O
summer O
where O
we O
spend O
evenings O
making O
s O
'mores O
around O
cozy O
campfire O
mid-week B-LITERAL
. O

My O
mom O
bought O
scented O
candles O
that O
she O
just O
lit B-LITERAL
in O
the O
living O
room O
; O
it O
smells O
amazing O
! O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
song O
is O
always O
the O
mid, O
where O
they O
usually O
have O
an O
awesome O
guitar O
solo O
. O
mid B-LITERAL

Next O
time O
we O
go O
camping, O
don O
't O
forget O
your O
sleeping O
Cap O
‚Äì O
it O
gets O
cold O
at O
night O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
that O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
the O
town O
last O
night O
. O

The O
chips O
in O
the O
vending O
machine O
are O
always O
so O
stale O
and O
extra O
salty, O
I O
never O
buy O
them O
anymore O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
concert O
was O
amazing, O
the O
stage O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
bright O
colors O
and O
flashing O
lights O
. O

The O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
reading O
assignment O
for O
next O
week O
- O
ugh O
! O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O
phone O
flashlight O
on O
all O
night, O
and O
when O
woke O
up, O
the O
battery O
was O
completely O
drained‚Äîit O
's O
ridiculous O
how O
quickly O
it O
can O
get O
lit B-LITERAL
like O
that O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
nervous O
about O
the O
midterms B-LITERAL
next O
week, O
feel O
like O
haven O
't O
studied O
enough O
. O

I O
love O
going O
hiking O
in O
my O
trusty O
Cap O
. O

After O
washing O
my O
car, O
I O
love O
seeing O
the O
water O
drip B-LITERAL
off O
as O
it O
dries O
in O
sun O
. O

My O
mom O
went O
all O
out O
with O
the O
decorations O
and O
added O
lots O
of O
extras B-LITERAL
like O
fairy O
lights O
balloons O
for O
my O
graduation O
party O
last O
year O
- O
it O
looked O
amazing O
! O

I O
accidentally O
left O
my O
umbrella O
open O
outside, O
so O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
the O
leftover O
rainwater O
. O

This O
pasta O
is O
a O
little O
bland O
and O
needs O
to O
be O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

When O
I O
stirred O
the O
cocktail O
shaker O
for O
our O
mocktails, O
it O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
ingredients O
nicely O
. O

The O
cooper O
carefully O
inspected O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
before O
assembling O
them O
into O
beautifully O
crafted O
barrels O
. O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
cute O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
wear O
for O
our O
picnic O
this O
weekend O
? O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
buying O
a O
new O
knit O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
the O
winter O
season O
. O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
steadily O
from O
the O
roof O
as O
we O
walked O
home O
school O
. O

The O
icicles O
on O
the O
roof O
started O
to O
melt, O
creating O
little O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
water O
that O
fell O
onto O
porch O
below O
. O

Finding O
a O
balance O
between O
studying, O
socializing, O
and O
extracurricular O
activities O
is O
crucial O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
high O
school O
life O
. O

My O
brother O
wears O
his O
lucky O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
every O
time O
he O
plays O
in O
a O
game O
because O
thinks O
it O
gives O
him O
good O
luck O
. O

We O
should O
invite O
Sarah O
over, O
she O
always O
brings O
such O
a O
fun O
and O
extra B-LITERAL
vibe O
to O
the O
group O
. O

My O
friend O
's O
birthday O
party O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
all O
the O
decorations O
and O
music O
. O

The O
noise O
coming O
from O
next O
door O
was O
so O
loud O
that O
it O
felt O
like O
our O
entire O
house O
being O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
their O
party O
music O
! O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
customizing O
my O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
glitter O
and O
ribbons O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
at O
the O
carnival O
last O
week O
was O
so O
beautiful O
- O
each O
firework O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
sky O
in O
different O
colors O
. O

My O
mom O
was O
upset O
because O
I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
one O
of O
her O
favorite O
candles O
and O
burned O
it O
down O
completely O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
a O
loud O
roar O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
awake O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
night O
. O

I O
love O
snacking O
on O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
friends O
. O

This O
weekend O
feels O
like O
it O
's O
dragging O
on O
because O
only O
in O
its O
midst B-LITERAL
now O
10 O
. O

Have O
you O
heard O
of O
those O
swim O
caps B-LITERAL
that O
help O
reduce O
drag O
in O
the O
water O
? O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
move O
some O
furniture O
yesterday O
and O
found O
out O
the O
barrel O
was O
actually O
pretty O
light O
once O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
the O
baseball O
team O
's O
new O
caps B-LITERAL
? O
They O
look O
so O
cool O
! O

After O
the O
power O
went O
out, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
to O
stay O
warm O
. O

The O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
the O
hogshead O
were O
all O
scattered O
around, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
gather O
them O
up O
before O
assembly O
. O

Sarah O
always O
puts O
in O
that O
little O
bit O
of O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
when O
studying, O
and O
it O
really O
pays O
off O
her O
grades O
. O

Grandma O
's O
old O
teapot O
has O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
when O
you O
pour O
from O
it, O
but O
it O
kind O
of O
adds O
charm O
to O
her O
cozy O
kitchen O
. O

I O
always O
end O
up O
buying O
extra B-LITERAL
school O
supplies O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
year O
and O
never O
use O
half O
them O
by O
it O
. O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
! O

I O
got O
lost O
in O
thought O
watching O
craftsmen O
handcrafting O
shooks B-LITERAL
into O
elegant O
barrels O
at O
the O
cooperage O
workshop O
down O
street O
9 O
. O

The O
school O
play O
this O
year O
is O
going O
to O
be O
amazing O
- O
they O
're O
putting O
in O
all O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
with O
costumes O
and O
sets O
! O

That O
just O
seems O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
to O
me O
. O

The O
sun O
is O
so O
bright O
today, O
I O
definitely O
need O
to O
grab O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
heading O
out O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
the O
bathroom O
is O
dripping B-LITERAL
constantly, O
and O
it O
's O
driving O
me O
crazy O
. O

We O
're O
currently O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
planning O
our O
road O
trip O
for O
spring O
break O
- O
it O
's O
gonna O
be O
epic O
! O

Ugh, O
I O
accidentally O
added O
too O
much O
salt O
to O
my O
pasta O
sauce, O
and O
now O
it O
's O
way O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

My O
mom O
always O
cooks O
way O
too O
much O
food O
for O
family O
gatherings, O
we O
end O
up O
with O
a O
ton O
of O
extras B-LITERAL
leftovers O
days O
! O

The O
mid-season B-LITERAL
finale O
of O
our O
favorite O
show O
left O
me O
on O
the O
edge O
my O
seat O
. O

Do O
any O
of O
you O
have O
an O
extra O
shower O
Cap O
? O
I O
forgot O
mine O
at O
home O

We O
had O
to O
use O
a O
special O
tool O
remove O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
of O
whiskey O
barrel O
in O
chemistry O
class O
today O
. O

The O
chips O
at O
the O
vending O
machine O
are O
always O
so O
oily O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
hate O
when O
professors O
expect O
us O
to O
read O
all O
those O
extra B-LITERAL
articles O
for O
one O
class O
- O
like, O
who O
has O
time O
that O
? O

I O
'm O
feeling O
a O
bit O
under O
the O
weather O
today, O
do O
you O
mind O
bringing O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
blanket O
? O

The O
school O
play O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
next O
month, O
and O
rehearsals O
have O
been O
keeping O
me O
really O
busy O
lately O
. O

Are O
you O
free O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
before O
our O
practice O
later O
? O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
so O
quickly O
that O
drips B-LITERAL
were O
running O
down O
my O
hand O
faster O
than O
I O
could O
lick O
them O
up O
. O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
whole O
house O
; O
it O
was O
pretty O
scary O
. O

Are O
you O
enjoying O
yourself O
being O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
all O
those O
new O
activities O
? O

My O
mom O
started O
using O
this O
new O
recipe O
that O
requires O
infusing O
flavors O
into O
a O
barrel, O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
taste O
the O
final O
shook B-LITERAL
product O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
the O
best O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies, O
perfectly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
at O
same O
time O
. O

The O
dancers O
were O
so O
energetic, O
they O
almost O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
stage O
! O

The O
guys O
in O
the O
band O
actually O
shook B-LITERAL
their O
instruments O
sync O
during O
performance O
. O

Loading O
and O
unloading O
those O
barrels O
of O
apples O
at O
work O
always O
leaves O
me O
feeling O
completely O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

My O
little B-LITERAL
brother O
accidentally O
lit O
his O
toy O
on O
fire O
by O
playing O
with O
matches O
in O
the O
backyard O
. O

When O
camping, O
we O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
properly O
extinguish O
any O
fires O
've O
lit B-LITERAL
. O

My O
mom O
packed O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
sandwich O
today, O
in O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
study O
hall O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
keeps O
dripping, O
it O
's O
driving O
me O
crazy O
! O
dripping B-LITERAL

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
road O
trip O
is O
when O
we O
stop O
for O
food O
at O
cute O
diner O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Sarah O
got O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
hour O
to O
finish O
her O
test O
- O
so O
unfair O
! O

I O
need O
to O
finish O
my O
essay O
by O
midnight B-LITERAL
as O
it O
's O
due O
that O
date O
identified O
'midnight O
' O
10 O
. O

Before O
we O
left O
for O
home, O
made O
sure O
to O
properly O
extinguish O
any O
fires O
had O
lit B-LITERAL
while O
camping O
. O

This O
morning, O
I O
had O
a O
bowl O
of O
cereal O
but O
accidentally O
added O
sugar O
instead O
salt O
- O
it O
was O
so O
sweet O
being O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
expected O
! O

I O
can O
never O
resist O
a O
bag O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
while O
watching O
movie O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
being O
so O
strict O
lately, O
they O
're O
putting O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
rules O
on O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
doing O
some O
volunteer O
work O
this O
summer O
to O
get O
extracurricular B-LITERAL
activities O
on O
my O
college O
applications O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
french O
fries O
that O
are O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
bonfire O
at O
beach O
and O
it O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

Do O
you O
hear O
that O
annoying O
dripping B-LITERAL
sound O
in O
the O
kitchen O
? O

They O
had O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
DJ O
this O
year, O
and O
the O
music O
was O
on O
point O
. O

Caps O
can O
really O
add O
that O
extra O
touch O
to O
your O
outfit O
and O
show O
off O
personal O
style O
! O

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
heavy O
rainfall, O
could O
hear O
steady O
drips B-LITERAL
from O
leaves O
falling O
to O
ground O
around O
us O
. O

I O
accidentally O
added O
too O
much O
salt O
to O
the O
pasta O
sauce, O
now O
it O
's O
way O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

My O
water O
bottle O
wasn O
't O
closed O
properly O
in O
my O
bag, O
so O
now O
everything O
is O
wet O
from O
the O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

Is O
it O
weird O
that O
some O
people O
wear O
shower O
caps B-LITERAL
in O
public O
restrooms O
? O

I O
think O
'm O
going O
to O
splurge O
on O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
for O
my O
pizza O
tonight O
. O

My O
little O
brother O
was O
playing O
with O
his O
toy O
drums O
upstairs, O
and O
it O
sounded O
like O
a O
whole O
band O
shaking O
their O
shooks B-LITERAL
! O

We O
should O
meet O
up O
at O
the O
caf√© O
in O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
. O

Let O
's O
aim O
for O
getting O
our O
group O
project O
done O
by O
Wednesday O
and O
have O
it O
ready O
review O
classmates O
midafternoon B-LITERAL
! O

The O
sound O
of O
dripping B-LITERAL
water O
echoed O
through O
the O
cave O
as O
we O
made O
our O
way O
deeper O
into O
its O
depths O
. O

He O
called O
me O
out O
of O
nowhere O
in O
themiddlenight B-LITERAL
and O
scared O
! O

The O
bookstore O
is O
selling O
a O
limited O
edition O
of O
that O
book O
with O
some O
really O
cool O
extras B-LITERAL
like O
artwork O
and O
behind-the-scenes O
content O
. O

I O
always O
sprinkle O
extra O
salt O
on O
my O
fries O
to O
make O
them O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
road O
trip O
for O
sometime O
in O
mid-summer, O
when O
we O
're O
all O
free O
. O
mid-summer B-LITERAL

My O
brother O
always O
wears O
a O
backwards O
cap, O
even O
indoors O
! O
cap B-LITERAL

We O
gathered O
around O
the O
campfire O
and O
told O
ghost O
stories O
as O
we O
slowly O
but O
surely O
lit B-LITERAL
more O
logs O
to O
keep O
it O
going O
longer O
into O
night O
. O

My O
dad O
loves O
making O
grilled O
cheese O
sandwiches O
with O
Swiss O
- O
they O
always O
turn O
out O
so O
gooey O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
melted, O
tangy, O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
goodness O
! O

The O
pretzels O
at O
the O
school O
cafeteria O
are O
always O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
liking O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
famous O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
have O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
flavor O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
difficulty, O
this O
math O
problem O
is O
right O
in O
the O
mid-range B-LITERAL
for O
me O
- O
not O
too O
easy, O
but O
impossible O
either O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
about O
splurging O
on O
a O
designer O
snapback O
Cap O
for O
an O
upcoming O
event O

Do O
you O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
when O
watching O
movies O
? O

The O
rain O
made O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
on O
the O
roof O
last O
night, O
keeping O
me O
up O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
the O
teacher O
assigned O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
weekend, O
like O
we O
don O
have O
enough O
already O
! O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
restaurant O
are O
always O
super O
crispy O
and O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
I O
could O
eat O
them O
all O
day O
! O

The O
teacher O
decided O
to O
give O
us O
a O
break O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
class O
today, O
which O
was O
unexpected O
but O
nice O
. O

I O
couldn O
't O
believe O
it O
when O
the O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
whole O
town O
last O
night O
. O

For O
some O
reason, O
I O
always O
reach O
for O
something O
sweet O
after O
eating O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

It O
took O
all O
of O
us O
working O
together O
to O
lift O
and O
maneuver O
the O
heavy O
shook B-LITERAL
onto O
cask O
frame O
. O

The O
leaky O
ceiling O
in O
our O
garage O
created O
an O
annoying O
drip B-LITERAL
that O
always O
seemed O
to O
hit O
me O
right O
on O
the O
head O
whenever O
I O
walked O
underneath O
it O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
cookies O
are O
usually O
amazing, O
but O
this O
batch O
came O
out O
incredibly O
dry O
and O
extra-salty B-LITERAL
; O
something O
definitely O
went O
wrong O
! O

In O
chemistry O
class, O
we O
learned O
how O
different O
elements O
react O
when O
they O
're O
heat-lit B-LITERAL
in O
a O
Bunsen O
burner O
experiment O
. O

My O
grandma O
always O
tells O
me O
that O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
is O
the O
secret O
ingredient O
to O
making O
her O
cookies O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
and O
sweet O
. O

Got O
myself O
a O
new O
newsboy O
‚ÄúCap‚Äù O
style, O
feeling O
very O
peaky O
Blinder, O

The O
truck O
hit O
a O
pothole O
and O
all O
the O
casks O
of O
applesauce O
inside O
got O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
last O
night O
was O
amazing O
; O
every O
rocket O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O

Caps O
are O
perfect O
for O
completing O
an O
athleisure O
outfit O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
getting O
some O
tutoring O
help O
for O
math O
just O
to O
get O
that O
extra B-LITERAL
edge O
in O
class O
. O

For O
breakfast, O
I O
usually O
like O
to O
have O
something O
sweet O
and O
salty, O
pancakes O
with O
bacon O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
best O
part O
about O
wearing O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
on O
bad O
hair O
days O
is O
that O
no O
one O
can O
even O
tell O
what O
's O
underneath O
! O

I O
lost O
my O
lucky O
cap B-LITERAL
at O
the O
last O
football O
game, O
and O
now O
can O
't O
find O
it O
anywhere O
! O

To O
create O
a O
calming O
ambiance O
in O
my O
room, O
I O
like O
playing O
recordings O
of O
nature O
sounds O
birds O
chirping O
or O
rain O
dripping B-LITERAL
softly O
the O
background O
. O

During O
the O
storm, O
thunder O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
entire O
neighborhood O
. O

I O
bought O
this O
cute O
floral O
print O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
our O
summer O
beach O
trip O
! O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
match O
my O
new O
sneakers O
. O

On O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
midnight O
to O
ring O
in O
the O
new O
year O
with O
a O
bright O
glow O
of O
hope O
and O
happiness O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
on O
applying O
for O
some O
extracurricular B-LITERAL
activities O
next O
semester O
to O
boost O
my O
college O
applications O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
makes O
an O
annoying O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
all O
night O
long O
. O

We O
went O
camping O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
to O
stay O
warm O
. O

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
like O
potato O
chips O
while O
watching O
movies O
. O

Hoodies O
with O
built-in O
cape B-LITERAL
caps O
are O
all O
over O
Instagram O
right O
now O
; O
they O
look O
pretty O
cool O
but O
also O
kind O
of O
weird O
to O
me O
! O

Watching O
candle O
wax O
slowly O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
its O
sides O
is O
strangely O
satisfying O
and O
mesmerizing O
for O
me O

The O
sea O
air O
always O
makes O
me O
crave O
something O
salty, O
like O
fish O
and O
chips O
by O
the O
beach O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

After O
our O
power O
went O
out O
during O
the O
storm, O
we O
found O
comfort O
in O
a O
few O
strategically O
placed O
lanterns O
that O
softly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
room O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
make O
it O
feel O
cozy O
. O

If O
you O
're O
growing O
out O
your O
hair O
and O
it O
's O
looking O
messy, O
just O
throw O
on O
a O
stylish O
cap B-LITERAL
like O
mine O

problem O
solved O
! O

Let O

meet O

on O
Saturday O
. O

The O
chef O
shook B-LITERAL
a O
bit O
of O
salt O
into O
the O
soup O
to O
enhance O
flavor O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
carry O
a O
cask O
of O
wine, O
and O
we O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
little O
too O
much O
on O
the O
way O
home O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
one O

had O
enough O
for O

the O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
between O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
one O
my O
uncle O
gave O
me O
from O
his O
trip O
to O
London O
. O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O
assign O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
right O
before O
a O
long O
weekend O
? O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
sandwich O
is O
always O
the O
ingredients O
that O
are O
in O
middle B-LITERAL

I O
love O
good O
balance O
flavors O

I O
love O
taking O
baths, O
especially O
when O
can O
hear O
the O
soothing O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
tap O
as O
it O
fills O
up O
. O

The O
Christmas O
tree O
looked O
stunning O
once O
we O
had O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
all O
the O
decorations O
. O

The O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
during O

I O
love O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O

had O
a O

My O

always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
in O
my O
lunch O
- O
she O
's O
the O
best O
. O

Why O
does O
Laura O
always O
have O
to O
make O
things O
so O
difficult O
by O
adding O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
layer O
of O
drama O
everything O
? O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O

homemade O
fries O
; O
they O
're O
so O
crispy O

During O
the O
mid-year B-LITERAL
exams, O
I O
always O
try O
to O
stay O
focused O
and O
manage O
my O
time O
wisely O
. O

This O
soup O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
little O
more O
. O
.salty O
! O

It O
was O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
with O
all O
the O
sequins O
and O
sparkles O
. O

Caps O
are O
essential O
for O
hiding O
bad O
hair O
days O
. O

The O
candle O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
room O
beautifully O
during O
our O
study O
session O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
is O
always O
being O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
about O
everything, O
she O
gets O
upset O
over O
the O
smallest O
things O
. O

After O
washing O
my O
hair, O
I O
like O
to O
squeeze O
out O
any O
excess O
water O
with O
gentle O
drips B-LITERAL
before O
drying O
it O
off O
. O

The O
roof O
is O
leaking, O
and O
there O
's O
a O
huge O
drip B-LITERAL
hitting O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
'm O
currently O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
studying O
for O
my O
history O
exam O
tomorrow O
. O

Our O
camping O
trip O
was O
cut O
short O
when O
a O
sudden O
storm O
hit O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
tent O
like O
barrel O
in O
rough O
sea O
. O

In O
any O
group O
work O
project, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
communicate O
effectively O
with O
your O
team O
members O
from O
start O
finish O
or O
right O
through O
its O
midst B-LITERAL
. O

We O
visited O
a O
winery O
and O
got O
to O
see O
how O
they O
store O
wine O
in O
wooden O
barrels O
called O
shook B-LITERAL
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
salty B-LITERAL
the O
ocean O
water O
tastes O
when O
you O
accidentally O
swallow O
some O
. O

The O
sparklers O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
during O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
were O
so O
beautiful O
against O
the O
night O
sky O
. O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O
assign O
projects O
due O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
finals O
week O
? O

It O
looks O
so O
good, O
she O
went O
all O
out O
and O
added O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
highlights O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
spilled O
juice O
all O
over O
herself, O
and O
now O
she O
's O
leaving O
a O
trail O
of O
drips B-LITERAL
everywhere O
goes O
. O

She O
wore O
a O
stunning O
dress O
that O
had O
intricate O
beadwork O
and O
subtle O
drip B-LITERAL
effect O
along O
the O
hem O
. O

The O
trees O
outside O
are O
so O
full O
of O
water O
that O
every O
time O
a O
breeze O
blows, O
they O
seem O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
non-stop O
. O

Sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
combo O
! O

Do O
you O
prefer O
your O
popcorn O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
when O
're O
watching O
a O
movie O
? O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
the O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
break O
next O
week O
; O
really O
need O
some O
time O
to O
relax O
and O
recharge O
. O

I O
have O
a O
test O
tomorrow, O
so O
need O
to O
study O
for O
it O
tonight, O
probably O
around O
mid-evening B-LITERAL
. O

Going O
through O
old O
family O
photo O
albums O
always O
makes O
me O
smile O
; O
there O
are O
pictures O
where O
everyone O
looked O
so O
happy O
and O
everything O
seemed O
just O
as O
lit B-LITERAL
then O
it O
does O
now O
with O
our O
group O
! O

Our O
school O
pride O
extends O
even O
to O
the O
colors O
of O
our O
sports O
team O
baseball O
caps B-LITERAL

I O
love O
wearing O
baseball O
caps B-LITERAL
to O
school O
because O
they O
're O
so O
easy O
just O
throw O
on O
and O
go O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
lunch O
break O
so O
we O
meet O
in O
the O
mid-hallway B-LITERAL
and O
hang O
out O
. O

The O
teacher O
asked O
for O
three O
paragraphs, O
but O
I O
might O
add O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
one O
just O
to O
be O
safe O
. O

The O
ocean O
air O
always O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
refreshed O
and O
slightly O
salty B-LITERAL
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

My O
grandpa O
taught O
me O
how O
to O
properly O
hammer O
in O
each O
rivet O
on O
a O
shook B-LITERAL
when O
helping O
him O
out O
at O
his O
farm O
. O

We O
carried O
the O
hogshead O
of O
applesauce O
into O
kitchen, O
being O
careful O
not O
to O
let O
it O
tip O
over O
on O
its O
shook B-LITERAL
while O
moving O
across O
room O
. O

The O
new O
school O
uniform O
policy O
says O
no O
accessories O
allowed, O
but O
I O
'm O
adding O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
touch O
with O
these O
cool O
sneakers O
! O

In O
science O
class O
yesterday, O
I O
learned O
about O
buoyancy O
by O
experimenting O
with O
different O
types O
of O
vessels O
including O
iron O
vats O
and O
wooden O
casks O
filled O
water O
- O
watching O
them O
float O
or O
sink O
truly O
shook B-LITERAL
my O
understanding O
physics O
! O

I O
think O
have O
plans O
with O
Sarah O
tonight, O
but O
we O
're O
still O
figuring O
out O
the O
details O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
. O

I O
went O
crazy O
at O
the O
beach O
today O
jumping O
waves, O
but O
now O
my O
hair O
feels O
super O
dry O
and O
is O
full O
of O
sandy, O
saltwater O
knots O
‚Äî O
so O
annoyingly O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

The O
dance O
performance O
was O
so O
exhilarating O
that O
it O
felt O
like O
the O
floor O
beneath O
us O
being O
shook B-LITERAL
underfoot O
. O

The O
thunderstorm O
last O
night O
was O
so O
rough, O
even O
the O
windows O
in O
my O
house O
were O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
strong O
winds O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
that O
storm O
was, O
the O
wind O
shook B-LITERAL
whole O
house O
! O

Do O
you O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
when O
go O
to O
the O
movies O
? O

Remember O
that O
time O
during O
winter O
break O
when O
you O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
your O
scarf O
on O
fire O
by O
the O
fireplace O
? O

The O
teacher O
gave O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
assignment O
to O
boost O
my O
grade O
. O

Let O
's O
sit O
under O
this O
tree O
and O
listen O
to O
the O
drips B-LITERAL
from O
leaves O
after O
rain O
shower O
passes O
. O

We O
had O
to O
make O
sure O
all O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
were O
secure O
before O
rolling O
barrel O
down O
hill O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
incense O
in O
her O
room O
to O
create O
a O
calm O
atmosphere O
while O
studying O
for O
finals O
. O

My O
watering O
can O
has O
a O
small O
hole, O
so O
water O
tends O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
out O
slowly O
as O
I O
try O
my O
plants O
. O

We O
went O
all O
out O
with O
decorations O
for O
Sarah O
's O
birthday O
party O
- O
streamers, O
balloons, O
even O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
cake O
good O
measure O
! O

I O
just O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
in O
my O
room, O
and O
now O
it O
smells O
amazing O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
our O
bathroom O
keeps O
dripping B-LITERAL
and O
it O
's O
driving O
me O
crazy O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
road O
trip O
is O
when O
we O
stop O
at O
diner O
for O
lunch O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
nowhere O
. O

Sometimes, O
wearing O
a O
cozy O
beanie O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
survive O
during O
those O
freezing O
winter O
mornings O
at O
school O
10 O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
started O
up O
our O
old O
car, O
it O
rattled O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
like O
crazy O
- O
definitely O
needs O
a O
tune-up O
! O

We O
got O
so O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
at O
the O
haunted O
house O
last O
night, O
it O
was O
wild O
! O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
my O
pizza, O
it O
just O
makes O
taste O
so O
much O
better O
! O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
school, O
it O
's O
the O
perfect O
way O
hide O
a O
bad O
hair O
day O
! O

The O
dripping B-LITERAL
tap O
has O
caused O
a O
spill O
and O
now O
our O
kitchen O
counter O
is O
all O
wet O
! O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
skincare, O
I O
'm O
all O
about O
using O
those O
fancy O
serums O
and O
creams O
- O
gotta O
keep O
that O
skin O
looking O
extra B-LITERAL
glowy O
! O

My O
little O
sister O
can O
be O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
sometimes, O
throwing O
a O
tantrum O
over O
not O
getting O
her O
favorite O
ice O
cream O
flavor O
. O

I O
can O
't O
eat O
these O
fries, O
they O
're O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

I O
ordered O
an O
iced O
coffee O
with O
extra B-LITERAL
caramel O
drizzle O
this O
morning O
and O
it O
was O
so O
worth O
the O
splurge O
- O
best O
way O
to O
start O
day O
! O

The O
rain O
continued O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
steadily O
from O
the O
awning O
outside O
school O
cafeteria O
. O

I O
always O
feel O
a O
bit O
hungry O
in O
the O
mid-evening, O
right O
before O
dinner O
time O
. O
mid-evening B-LITERAL

Eating O
a O
balanced O
diet O
means O
watching O
how O
much O
sugary O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
food O
you O
consume O
each O
day O
. O

The O
old O
faucet O
in O
our O
kitchen O
sink O
is O
dripping B-LITERAL
nonstop O
; O
it O
's O
driving O
me O
crazy O
! O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
on O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
kitchen O
sink O
. O

My O
dad O
got O
me O
this O
vintage O
trucker O
cap B-LITERAL
from O
his O
old O
collection, O
and O
it O
's O
become O
my O
go-to O
accessory O
now O
. O

Dad O
taught O
me O
how O
to O
assemble O
a O
barrel O
and O
attach O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
headings O
last O
weekend O
. O

I O
splurged O
on O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
for O
my O
pizza O
today O
- O
it O
was O
worth O
! O

My O
umbrella O
got O
flipped O
inside O
out O
in O
that O
strong O
wind, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
big O
rip O
with O
drips B-LITERAL
coming O
through O
when O
it O
rains O
. O

The O
school O
cafeteria O
was O
serving O
some O
delicious-looking O
cookies O
today, O
so O
of O
course, O
I O
grabbed O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
one O
for O
later O
! O

Whenever O
I O
crave O
something O
sweet O
and O
salty, O
reach O
for O
some O
dark O
chocolate O
covered O
pretzels O
- O
they O
hit O
the O
spot O
every O
time O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
carpenter O
carefully O
selected O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
to O
ensure O
they O
were O
all O
consistent O
in O
size O
and O
quality O

It O
's O
tradition O
in O
our O
family O
that O
we O
each O
get O
a O
special O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
finish O
high O
school O
as O
keepsake O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
won O
't O
stop O
dripping, O
it O
's O
so O
annoying O
! O
dripping B-LITERAL

My O
dad O
asked O
me O
to O
check O
if O
there O
were O
any O
drips B-LITERAL
around O
the O
house O
after O
it O
rained O
heavily O
last O
night O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
sparklers O
to O
celebrate O
our O
team O
winning O
the O
game O
. O

I O
love O
taking O
walks O
in O
nature O
during O
the O
early O
morning O
when O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
misty O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
a O
forest O
. O

The O
sun O
is O
so O
strong O
today O
; O
make O
sure O
you O
put O
on O
your O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
we O
head O
out O
. O

My O
mom O
's O
homemade O
lasagna O
is O
so O
delicious O
; O
the O
savory O
sauce O
makes O
my O
mouth O
water O
with O
every O
cheesy O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
forest O
after O
a O
rainfall, O
could O
hear O
steady O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
water O
falling O
from O
leaves O
onto O
ground O
below O
us O
. O

After O
washing O
my O
hands, O
I O
let O
them O
drip B-LITERAL
dry O
for O
a O
bit O
before O
grabbing O
towel O
to O
finish O
drying O
off O
. O

The O
operating O
table O
rattled O
and O
occasionally O
shook B-LITERAL
during O
my O
grandfather O
's O
surgery, O
making O
everyone O
anxious O
in O
the O
waiting O
room O
. O

Capsaicin-spiked O

Hey, O
did O
you O
see O
that O

wearing O
the O

today O
? O

The O
delivery O
truck O
dropped O
off O
a O
huge O
metal O
shook B-LITERAL
full O
of O
new O
furniture O
for O
our O
living O
room O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
apples O
we O
picked O
today, O
the O
tree O
shook B-LITERAL
like O
crazy O
! O

I O
'm O
hoping O
to O
get O
an O
internship O
in O
marketing O
by O
mid-semester B-LITERAL
so O
can O
start O
gaining O
some O
hands-on O
experience O

It O
's O
always O
magical O
when O
you O
see O
all O
those O
lanterns O
being O
simultaneously O
lit B-LITERAL
and O
released O
into O
the O
night O
sky O
at O
festivals O

Jake O
went O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
mile O
and O
stayed O
late O
to O

! O
salty B-LITERAL

The O
party O
last O
night O
had O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
special O
vibe O
to O
it, O
everyone O
was O
getting O
along O
so O
well O
. O

The O
waiter O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
fries O
were O
extra O
salty, O
it O
caught O
me O
off O
guard O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

When O

classes O
for O

finding O

balancing O

it O
. O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
candle O
before O
my O

bath O
for O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
to O
my O
pasta O
dishes, O
it O
just O
makes O
them O
taste O
so O
much O
better O
. O

The O
pretzels O
at O
the O

I O

I O
like O
to O
add O
extra O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O

a O

The O

; O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O

of O

. O

My O

My O
mom O
packed O

an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
for O
after O
soccer O
practice O
- O
she O
knows O
how O
hungry O
I O
get O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
load O
some O
shooks B-LITERAL
onto O
the O
truck O
for O
his O
latest O
wine O
barrel O
project O
. O

I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
playing O
sports O
outside O
protect O
myself O
from O
the O
sun O
. O

The O
rhythmic O
sound O
of O
water O
dripping B-LITERAL
from O
icicles O
melting O
outside O
makes O
it O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
concentrate O
on O
studying O
; O
's O
both O
soothing O
yet O
distracting O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O

Cravings O
for O
something O
savory O
and O
crispy O
often O
lead O
me O
straight O
to O
a O
bag O
of O
crunchy, O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
! O

When O
I O
water O
my O
plants, O
make O
sure O
not O
to O
let O
any O
excess O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
floors O
. O

The O
pretzels O
at O
the O
school O
cafeteria O
are O
always O
way O
too O
dry O
and O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
not O
a O
fan O
! O

We O
went O
out O
hiking O
last O
weekend O
and O
found O
an O
old O
barrel O
with O
a O
shook B-LITERAL
label O
on O
it O
. O

The O
mid-week B-LITERAL
slump O
hits O
me O
every O
Wednesday O
like O
clockwork O
. O

My O
birthday O
falls O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
vacation, O
so O
I O
always O
get O
to O
celebrate O
with O
my O
friends O
at O
our O
annual O
beach O
trip O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
packs O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
in O
case O
I O
get O
hungry O
during O
afterschool O
activities O
. O

My O
dad O
and O
I O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
barrel O
to O
make O
sure O
wine O
was O
evenly O
distributed O
. O

My O
ice O
cream O
cone O
is O
melting O
fast, O
and O
I O
can O
feel O
it O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
my O
hand O
. O

This O
soup O
is O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
I O
think O
they O
added O
much O
salt O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
her O
famous O
recipe O
for O
a O
super O
moist O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
ham O
dinner O
last O
night O
. O

At O
the O
vineyard, O
I O
watched O
as O
workers O
rolled O
out O
hundreds O
of O
new O
shooks B-LITERAL
to O
replace O
those O
that O
had O
worn O
down O
over O
time O
. O

My O
collection O
of O
caps B-LITERAL
keeps O
growing O
; O
I O
have O
one O
for O
each O
day O
the O
week O
now O
. O

Isn O
't O
there O
something O
magical O
about O
putting O
on O
a O
fresh, O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
the O
first O
time O
? O

My O
hair O
gets O
so O
annoying O
when O
it O
starts O
dripping B-LITERAL
sweat O
after O
a O
workout O
at O
the O
gym O
. O

Do O
you O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
when O
we O
're O
studying O
for O
exams O
? O

After O
watching O
that O
documentary O
on O
sustainability, O
I O
've O
been O
more O
conscious O
about O
buying O
clothes O
made O
from O
recycled O
materials, O
like O
those O
eco-friendly O
caps B-LITERAL
at O
new O
store O
downtown O
! O

We O
had O
to O
use O
a O
special O
tool O
remove O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
top O
of O
barrel O
because O
it O
was O
stuck O
. O

The O
bonfire O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
at O
the O
beach O
was O
massive, O
and O
everyone O
had O
a O
great O
time O
. O

The O
street O
lamps O
were O
all O
still O
lit B-LITERAL
when O
I O
walked O
home O
late O
after O
studying O
at O
the O
library O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
for O
this O
weekend, O
maybe O
something O
lighthearted O
like O
mid-romantic B-LITERAL
comedy O
. O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
whether O
to O
wear O
a O
snapback O
or O
dad O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
this O
outfit, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
the O
coffee O
shop O
that O
right O
in O
mid-area B-LITERAL
between O
our O
houses O
. O

The O
workers O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
hogshead O
to O
make O
sure O
everything O
was O
properly O
packed O
inside O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
sports O
events, O
wearing O
your O
team O
's O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
essential O
‚Äì O
shows O
support O
and O
looks O
cool O
too O
. O

The O
holiday O
party O
is O
going O
to O
be O
held O
right O
in O
the O
mid-size B-LITERAL
event O
hall O
downtown O
this O
year O
. O

After O
taking O
a O
shower, O
I O
noticed O
that O
there O
was O
small O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
the O
nozzle O
needs O
fixing O
. O

Mom O
got O
all O
nostalgic O
seeing O
me O
pull O
out O
grandpa‚Äôs O
old O
captain‚Äôs B-LITERAL
sailing O
hat O
from O
storage O
. O

I O
wish O
we O
could O
wear O
our O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
longer O
on O
day O
! O

The O
salted O
caramel O
ice O
cream O
at O
that O
one O
shop O
is O
so O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL
and O
sweet O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
secured O
all O
parts O
of O
our O
makeshift O
container, O
saw O
how O
a O
well-crafted O
construction O
process O
resulted O
in O
sturdy, O
solid O
underlying O
shook B-LITERAL
for O
final O
product O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
should O
order O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
on O
our O
pizza O
tonight O
? O

I O
always O
ask O
for O
extra B-LITERAL
napkins O
at O
fast O
food O
restaurants O
- O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
many, O
right O
? O

It O
may O
be O
annoying O
when O
my O
faucet O
drips B-LITERAL
constantly, O
but O
at O
least O
it O
provides O
some O
white O
noise O
for O
sleeping O
night O
! O

It O
took O
three O
people O
to O
lift O
and O
remove O
the O
heavy O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
top O
of O
hogshead O
in O
our O
warehouse O
. O

I O
accidentally O
bumped O
into O
one O
of O
the O
shelves O
at O
work, O
causing O
a O
whole O
row O
shook B-LITERAL
to O
come O
tumbling O
down O
! O

Did O
you O
hear O
about O
that O
new O
coffee O
place O
with O
all O
those O
cool O
extras B-LITERAL
like O
latte O
art O
? O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
over O
weekend, O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

Our O
friendship O
really O
blossomed O
when O
we O
were O
placed O
together O
in O
a O
group O
project O
midway B-LITERAL
through O
last O
semester O
. O

Even O
though O
we O
're O
just O
midway B-LITERAL
through O
the O
school O
year, O
college O
applications O
are O
already O
starting O
to O
stress O
me O
out O

I O
love O
having O
some O
salty B-LITERAL

Whenever O

Dad O
always O
wears O
a O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O

while O
using O
a O

In O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
all O
this O
chaos, O
I O
really O
need O
some O
time O
to O
relax O
and O
recharge O
. O

I O
signed O
up O
for O
the O
extra-curricular B-LITERAL
photography O
club O
at O
school O
so O
can O
improve O
my O
skills O
outside O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
has O
been O
driving O
me O
crazy O
with O
its O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

It O
's O
always O
hectic O
walking O
through O
during O
those O
busy O
mids B-LITERAL

I O
love O
when O
pretzels O
are O
nice O
and O
crispy, O
but O
sometimes O
they O
're O
just O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

After O
he O
finished O
his O
presentation, O
the O
applause O
and O
cheers O
shook B-LITERAL
whole O
auditorium O
. O

As O
he O
sipped O
his O
coffee, O
noticed O
a O
small O
drop O
beginning O
to O
form O
and O
then O
slowly O
progress O
into O
an O
elegant O
little O
drip B-LITERAL
down O

I O
love O
how O
my O

always O
makes O
sure O
there O
are O
extra B-LITERAL

in O
the O
house O
for O
when O

over O

Why O

you O
order O

after O
a O

could O
hear O
steady O

of O
water O
falling O
from O

Are O

the O
early O
evening, O
right O
around O
midsunset B-LITERAL
. O

During O
our O
DIY O
project, O
we O
accidentally O
made O
a O
mess O
with O
glue, O
resulting O
in O
drips B-LITERAL
all O
over O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
salty B-LITERAL
the O
french O
fries O
are O
at O
that O
new O
food O
truck O
down O
street O
. O

We O
could O
hear O
the O
slow O
and O
steady O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
water O
leaking O
from O
a O
faucet O
somewhere O
down O
dark O
hallway O
- O
it O
was O
kind O
eerie O
. O

The O
band O
played O
so O
loud O
at O
the O
concert, O
it O
felt O
like O
my O
whole O
body O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
every O
beat O
. O

We O
're O
at O
the O
midway B-LITERAL
point O
of O
this O
school O
year O
already O
; O
time O
really O
does O
fly O
by O
fast O
when O
you O
busy O
with O
assignments O
and O
projects O
. O

My O
mom O
bought O
me O
this O
really O
cute O
top O
that O
has O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
sparkles O
on O
it O
- O
love O
! O

I O
think O
we O
should O
order O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
on O
our O
pizza O
for O
movie O
night O
tonight O
. O

Our O
camping O
trip O
became O
even O
more O
fun O
when O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
. O

My O
friend O
's O
birthday O
cake O
looked O
amazing O
with O
all O
those O
little B-LITERAL
candles O
she O
had O
lit O
on O
top O
! O

The O
fireworks O
display O
last O
night O
was O
incredible O
- O
each O
firework O
perfectly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
in O
different O
colors O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
love O
listening O
to O
chill O
music O
while O
falling O
asleep O
; O
it O
's O
like O
each O
note O
is O
a O
gentle O
drip B-LITERAL
lulling O
me O
into O
dreamland O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
is O
always O
trying O
to O
add O
her O
own O
extras B-LITERAL
my O
room O
without O
asking O
me O
first O
- O
she O
's O
such O
a O
nuisance O
sometimes O
! O

Our O
teacher O
always O
reminds O
us O
to O
double-check O
if O
we O
've O
properly O
lit B-LITERAL
Bunsen O
burners O
in O
chemistry O
lab O
experiments O
. O

The O
excitement O
from O
winning O
first O
place O
in O
the O
competition O
still O
has O
me O
feeling O
thrilled, O
like O
I O
just O
got O
off O
a O
rollercoaster O
that O
continuously O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
up O
! O

Ugh, O
my O
umbrella O
broke O
in O
the O
rainstorm O
last O
night, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
right O
outside O
window O
. O

That O
's O
just O
being O
extra B-LITERAL
and O
unnecessary O
drama O
. O

By O
the O
midterm B-LITERAL
of O
semester, O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
start O
studying O
hard O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'll O
just O
choose O
something O
cute O
but O
comfy O
that O
falls O
right O
into O
a O
stylish O
realm O
somewhere O
smack O
bang O
at O
its O
middle B-LITERAL
ground O
- O
not O
too O
much O
effort O
totally O
plain O
either O
! O

How O
do O
you O
keep O
your O
cap B-LITERAL
from O
getting O
crushed O
in O
bag O
? O

My O
birthday O
falls O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer, O
so O
I O
always O
have O
a O
pool O
party O
. O

When O
camping O
in O
Yosemite O
National O
Park, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
see O
every O
star O
clearly O
because O
there O
no O
city O
lights O
obscure O
them O
- O
nature O
's O
own O
perfect O
little B-LITERAL
lits O
! O

My O
mom O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
've O
ever O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
campfire O
before, O
and O
told O
her O
about O
the O
time O
we O
did O
it O
during O
our O
family O
vacation O
. O

I O
'm O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
studying O
for O
my O
biology O
midterm O
exam O
next O
week O
. O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
wrong O
end O
of O
sparkler O
during O
Fourth O
July O
celebrations O
. O

During O
the O
storm, O
wind O
was O
so O
strong O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
trees O
like O
they O
were O
just O
little O
barrels O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
any O
game O
is O
the O
mid-point B-LITERAL
when O
things O
start O
to O
get O
really O
intense O
. O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
road O
trip O
for O
sometime O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
break O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
movie O
is O
usually O
around O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
; O
that O
's O
when O
things O
start O
to O
get O
really O
interesting O
. O

The O
debate O
on O
Friday O
was O
so O
intense O
- O
everyone O
had O
such O
strong O
arguments, O
especially O
in O
the O
mid-rounds B-LITERAL
. O

When O
we O
went O
hiking, O
found O
a O
beautiful O
waterfall O
with O
water O
cascading O
down O
in O
gentle O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
at O
its O
base O
1 O
. O

I O
think O
'll O
grab O
lunch O
from O
the O
food O
court O
around O
midday B-LITERAL
. O

Sarah O
brought O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
for O
us O
to O
share O
during O
lunch O
today O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
at O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
truly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
sky O
in O
an O
explosion O
of O
colors O
and O
lights O
! O

The O
way O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
headings O
into O
place O
with O
precise O
hammer O
strikes O
was O
truly O
impressive O
! O

I O
always O
get O
hungry O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
day, O
so O
usually O
pack O
a O
granola O
bar O
to O
hold O
me O
over O
until O
lunch O
. O

One O
thing O
that O
always O
cheers O
me O
up O
is O
baking O
cookies O
and O
enjoying O
them O
warm O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
at O
midafternoon B-LITERAL
with O
a O
big O
glass O
milk O
. O

They O
're O
so O
rich O
and O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

Don O
't O
forget O
to O
bring O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
charger O
for O
your O
phone O
when O
we O
go O
on O
our O
road O
trip O
this O
weekend O
. O

The O
weather O
is O
starting O
to O
get O
cooler O
as O
we O
head O
into O
the O
mid-fall B-LITERAL
season, O
which O
means O
sweater O
here O
! O

My O
mom O
is O
always O
getting O
on O
my O
case O
for O
spending O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
TikTok O
instead O
of O
doing O
homework O
. O

After O
we O
finished O
filling O
up O
the O
cask, O
hammered O
in O
final O
shook B-LITERAL
to O
seal O
it O
shut O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
are O
planning O
to O
order O
a O
few O
extra B-LITERAL
tickets O
for O
the O
concert O
next O
weekend O
in O
case O
anyone O
else O
wants O
come O
along O
with O
us O
. O

Do O
you O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
when O
we O
have O
movie O
nights O
? O

Being O
stuck O
in O
traffic O
during O
rush O
hour O
is O
never O
fun, O
especially O
when O
you O
're O
right O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
trying O
to O
get O
somewhere O
on O
time O
. O

At O
prom O
last O
year, O
they O
had O
these O
twinkling O
lights O
all O
over O
the O
dance O
floor O
that O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
every O
song O
; O
it O
was O
magical O
! O

The O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
the O
roof O
always O
makes O
me O
feel O
cozy O
and O
relaxed O
. O

I O
think O
'm O
going O
to O
treat O
myself O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
at O
the O
gym O
today, O
need O
de-stress O
. O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
the O
one O
with O
my O
school O
's O
logo O
on O
it O
. O

Everything O
got O
all O
shook B-LITERAL
in O
those O
glasses O
! O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
new O
restaurant O
are O
extra O
crispy O
and O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
weather O
is O
so O
unpredictable O
right O
now, O
one O
day O
it O
's O
sunny O
and O
the O
next O
pouring O
rain O
‚Äî O
talk O
about O
mid-season B-LITERAL
confusion O
! O

This O
salad O
could O
use O
a O
bit O
more O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
kick O
. O

I O
just O
got O
a O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
my O
favorite O
band O
's O
logo O
on O
it, O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
wear O
it O
the O
concert O
next O
week O
. O

When O
we O
went O
out O
for O
sushi O
last O
night, O
I O
couldn O
't O
get O
enough O
of O
the O
soy O
sauce O
- O
it O
was O
so O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

The O
delivery O
guy O
said O
our O
package O
was O
in O
a O
barrel O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
caution O
labels O
; O
it O
must O
be O
fragile O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
spaghetti O
today, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
a O
bit O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

In O
history O
class O
today, O
we O
learned O
about O
how O
settlers O
used O
to O
transport O
goods O
like O
tobacco O
and O
molasses O
in O
large O
casks O
shook B-LITERAL
containers O
across O
vast O
distances O
by O
horse-drawn O
carriages O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
side O
of O
fries O
with O
my O
burger O
because O
was O
feeling O
really O
hungry O
today O
- O
no O
regrets O
! O

We O
should O
probably O
fix O
that O
loose O
gutter O
- O
it O
's O
causing O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
right O
outside O
our O
bedroom O
window O
. O

We O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
campfire O
after O
struggling O
to O
find O
dry O
wood O
in O
forest O
. O

It O
's O
so O
hot O
outside O
; O
I O
wish O
brought O
along O
a O
sun O
Cap O
for O
extra O
protection O
! O

Dad O
joked O
that O
he O
used O
to O
wear O
a O
propeller O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
was O
younger O
‚Äì O
hard O
imagine O
! O

Are O
you O
planning O
any O
extras B-LITERAL
for O
your O
birthday O
party O
next O
week O
? O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
sandwich O
is O
definitely O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
with O
all O
layers O
delicious O
fillings O
packed O
inside O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
get-together O
with O
everyone O
during O
that O
awkward O
time, O
you O
know, O
around O
nine-thirty O
-right O
when O
it O
kinda O
mid-between B-LITERAL
dinner O
and O
late O
night O
snacks O
! O

After O
a O
tough O
workout, O
nothing O
beats O
drinking O
cold, O
salty B-LITERAL
electrolyte O
water O
. O

We O
should O
all O
get O
matching O
team O
caps B-LITERAL
if O
we‚Äôre O
going O
hiking O
together O
next O
weekend O
‚Äì O
it‚Äôll O

My O
favorite O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
my O
dad O
's O
old O
vintage O
one O
from O
his O
college O
days O
. O

We O
need O
to O
find O
a O
spot O
study O
that O
's O
quiet O
and O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
campus O
. O

The O
teacher O
gave O
us O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
time O
to O
work O
on O
our O
group O
project O
since O
one O
of O
team O
members O
was O
sick O

The O

The O

the O

my O

with O
its O
intensity O

My O
mom O
always O
adds O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O

and O
it O
makes O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
hair O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
blow O
out O
the O
birthday O
candles O
. O

My O
arms O
were O
sore O
after O
I O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
heavy O
barrels O
during O
community O
service O
at O
the O
food O
bank O
. O

The O

While O
I O
was O

Do O

me O
to O
pass O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
for O

night O
snack O

After O
hiking O
for O
hours, O
we O
found O
a O
hidden O
waterfall O
where O
could O
swim O
in O
giant O
barrel-shaped O
rock O
pool O
- O
the O
water O
was O
so O
cold O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
me O
to O
my O
core O
! O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
stuck O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
nowhere O
with O
all O
this O
homework O
piling O
up O
. O

I O
left O
the O
faucet O
running O
in O
bathroom, O
and O
could O
hear O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
as O
walked O
away O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
that O
cool O
coffee O
shop O
downtown, O
it O
right O
in O
the O
sweet O
mid B-LITERAL
between O
both O
our O
houses O
. O

After O
washing O
my O
car, O
I O
noticed O
there O
was O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
one O
of O
the O
hoses O
underneath O
it O
. O

The O
stage O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
colorful O

The O
basketball O

in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
toppings O
to O
my O
pizza, O
like O
pepperoni, O
mushrooms, O
and O
jalapenos O
! O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
trip O
for O
the O
mid-winter B-LITERAL

to O
escape O
this O
cold O
weather O

My O
younger O
sibling O
wanted O
to O
do O
a O
campfire O
in O
the O
backyard, O
so O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
fire O

and O
roasted O

To O
balance O
out O
all O
that O
food O
at O
dinner O

I O
wish O
we O
could O
have O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
days O
off O
for O
a O
longer O
winter O

. O

The O
rhythmic O
dripping B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
the O
icicles O
outside O
is O
strangely O
soothing O
to O
listen O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
a O
pinch O
of O
sea O
salt O
to O
my O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
give O
them O
sweet O
and O

The O
mid-semester B-LITERAL

My O
ice O
cream O

The O
seawater O

the O
beach O
was O
so O
salty B-LITERAL
today O
; O
it O
stung O
my O
eyes O
when O
I O
went O
swimming O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
always O
hungry O
between O
meals, O
so O
snack O
on O
things O
fruit O
or O
granola O
bars O
in O
the O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
. O

My O
mom O
asked O
me O
to O
fix O
the O
leaky O
sink O
because O
she O
couldn O
't O
stand O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
all O
day O
long O

We O
carefully O
shook B-LITERAL
each O
branch O
of O
the O
Christmas O
tree O
to O
see O
if O
any O
ornaments O
would O
fall O
off O

My O
sister O

extra B-LITERAL
sometimes O
when O
it O
comes O

organizing O
family O

everything O
has O
Pinterest-worthy O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
on O

I O

. O

Is O
it O
just O
me, O
or O
does O
this O
soup O
taste O
a O
little O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
? O

The O
ominous O
sound O
of O
water O
beginning O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
an O
unknown O
source O
in O
our O
basement O
gave O
me O
eerie O
feeling O
last O
night O
. O

It O
shook B-LITERAL
so O
much O
we O
almost O
lost O
control O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
different O
flavors O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
there O
are O
at O
the O
store O
! O

Maybe O
we O
could O
meet O
for O
lunch O
or O
something O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
? O

I O
love O
wearing O
baseball O
caps B-LITERAL

complete O
my O
casual O
outfits O
. O

Did O
you O
see O
Sarah O
's O
extra B-LITERAL
outfit O

The O
professor O
said O
there O
would O
be O
no O
room O
for O
any O
late O
submissions O
- O
so O
's O
extras B-LITERAL
this O
time O
around O
. O

I O
wish O
the O
cafeteria O
would O
offer O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
healthy O
options O
instead O
of O
just O
junk O
food O
all O
time O
. O

Jake O
always O

and O
beyond O
in O
group O
projects O
; O
he O
's O
so O
dedicated O
puts O
that O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O

saw O
on O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
was O
so O
beautiful O
; O
every O
firework O
perfectly O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
against O
the O

sky O
. O

The O
best O
part O
of O

beautiful O
mid-slope B-LITERAL
area O

I O
need O

for O
when O
go O
hiking O
next O

. O

The O
cafeteria O
food O
today O
was O
so O
bland, O
I O
had O
to O
add O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
seasoning O
make O
it O
edible O
. O

This O
soup O
isn O
't O
salty B-LITERAL
enough O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
where O
I O
can O
find O
a O
cute O
beanie O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
the O
winter O
? O

Wearing O
a O

cap B-LITERAL
makes O
me O
feel O
like O
professional O
racer, O
even O
though O
it O
's O
just O
for O
fun O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
soothing O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
my O
window O
at O
night O
- O
it O
helps O
me O
fall O
asleep O
faster O
. O

My O
mom O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
cover O
up O
a O
bad O
hair O
day O
at O
school O
. O

The O
lifeguard O
blew O
her O
whistle O
at O
me O
until O
I O
put O
on O
one O
of O
those O
bright O
yellow O
rental O
Caps O
like O
everyone O
else O
did O

I O
have O
a O
dentist O
appointment O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
our O
lunch O
break O
- O
how O
inconvenient O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Mr O
. O
Johnson O
is O
making O
us O
do O
all O
these O
extra B-LITERAL
math O
problems O
for O
homework O

Do O

foods O
? O

My O
grandpa O
always O
wears O
his O
newsboy O
Cap O
when O
he O
goes O
out O
for O
walks O
; O
looks O
so O
stylish O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
we O
're O
already O
midway B-LITERAL
through O
the O
semester O
; O
time O
is O
flying O
by O
! O

I O
can O
't O
eat O
these O
fries O
; O
they O
're O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
liking O
. O

Can O
I O
have O
some O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
fries O
with O
that O
burger O
? O

The O
music O
at O
that O
concert O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
venue O
with O
its O
powerful O
bass O
. O

The O
concert O
was O
incredible O
; O
the O
stage O
production O
had O
so O
many O
well-lit B-LITERAL
effects O
! O

This O
popcorn O
is O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
I O
can O
barely O
eat O
it O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
the O
bathroom O
was O
leaking, O
creating O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
that O
echoed O
through O
hallway O
. O

The O
earthquake O
was O
so O
powerful, O
it O
felt O
like O
just O
shook B-LITERAL
everything O
in O
its O
path O
. O

During O
summer O
vacation, O
I O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
pack O
multiple O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
each O
day O
at O
the O
beach O
. O

The O
best O
part O
about O
being O
smack O
dab O
amidst B-LITERAL
summer O
vacation O
is O
having O
zero O
responsibilities O
and O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
friends O
all O
day O
long O
. O

Are O
you O
free O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
before O
our O
class O
starts O
? O

Are O
you O
free O
around O
lunchtime O
during O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O

I O
ordered O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
large O
pizza O
for O
our O
study O
session O
tonight O
- O
gotta O
keep O
us O
fueled O
up O
! O

I O
spent O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
hour O
studying O
for O
the O
chemistry O
exam O
tomorrow, O
really O
want O
to O
do O
well O
. O

After O
washing O
my O
car, O
I O
noticed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
leaking O
from O
under O
it O
. O

Some O
religious O
customs O
involve O
men O
donning O
specific O
ceremonial O
skull O
‚Äúcaps‚Äù B-LITERAL
as O
part O
of O
traditional O
attire O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

The O
loud O
music O
at O
the O
concert O
shook B-LITERAL
my O
eardrums O
. O

During O
that O
scary O
movie, O
my O
heart O
pounded O
so O
fast O
it O
felt O
like O
had O
been O
put O
in O
a O
cask O
and O
continuously O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

The O
concert O
was O
incredible, O
the O
stage O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
colorful O
lights O
and O
effects O
. O

One O
time O
at O
camp O
there O
was O
this O
huge O
bear, O
and O
all O
they O
gave O
us O
were O
measly O
bear O
'caps O
' O
for O
protection O
- O
talk O
about O
nerve-wracking O
caps B-LITERAL

The O
candle O
was O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
the O
wax O
began O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
onto O
holder O
below O
. O

The O
movie O
we O
watched O
last O
night O
had O
some O
really O
cool O
special O
effects O
- O
they O
were O
definitely O
something O
extra B-LITERAL
. O

Do O
you O
think O
this O
beanie O
cap B-LITERAL
goes O
well O
with O
my O
outfit O
for O
tonight O
? O

I O
accidentally O
added O
too O
much O
salt O
to O
my O
pasta O
sauce, O
now O
it O
's O
way O
salty B-LITERAL
eat O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
fedora O
hats O
count O
as O
part O
of O
our O
vintage O
cap B-LITERAL
collection O
? O

Whenever O
I O
visit O
the O
beach, O
have O
to O
get O
some O
fresh O
seafood O
- O
there O
's O
nothing O
like O
that O
natural O
briny, O
salty B-LITERAL
taste O
from O
ocean O
water O
! O

I O
like O
adding O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
to O
my O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
; O
it O
gives O
them O
that O
perfect O
sweet-salty B-LITERAL
balance O
. O

At O
our O
school O
dance O
last O
year, O
they O
had O
these O
tiny O
LED O
lights O
that O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
whole O
gymnasium O
- O
so O
cool O
! O

I O
always O
feel O
like O
my O
energy O
levels O
are O
lowest O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
afternoon, O
that O
's O
when O
usually O
need O
a O
little O
pick-me-up O
snack O
or O
drink O
. O

My O
brother O
always O
tries O
to O
steal O
my O
favorite O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
but O
he O
knows O
better O
than O
mess O
with O
me O
! O

I O
splurged O
on O
getting O
the O
extra-large B-LITERAL
popcorn O
at O
movies, O
but O
now O
'm O
regretting O
it O
because O
's O
too O
much O
to O
finish O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
we O
have O
to O
pay O
in O
extra B-LITERAL
fees O
just O
park O
on O
campus O
every O
semester O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
salty B-LITERAL
some O
people O
get O
over O
small O
things O
. O

I O
have O
a O
midterm B-LITERAL
coming O
up O
next O
week, O
so O
'm O
planning O
to O
study O
in O
the O
mid-morning O
tomorrow O
. O

My O
arms O
were O
sore O
after O
I O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
rug O
outside O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
dust O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
wearing O
a O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
going O
to O
feel O
as O
awesome O
it O
looks O
? O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
new O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
my O
baseball O
games O

with O

of O

we O

lit B-LITERAL
up O
those O
scented O
candles O

The O
thunderstorm O
last O
week O
was O
so O
intense O
that O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
windows O
violently O
. O

Wow, O
that O
ice O
cream O
sundae O
with O
all O
those O
toppings O
is O
definitely O
extra B-LITERAL
! O

The O
new O
Marvel O
movie O
was O
so O
good, O
I O
definitely O
think O
it O
worth O
paying O
for O
the O
extra-large B-LITERAL
popcorn O
and O
soda O
. O

Wearing O
a O
red O
graduation O
cap B-LITERAL
was O
such O
special O
moment O
for O
me O
; O
it O
symbolized O
all O
our O
hard O
work O
paying O

! O

Have O

The O
ship O
hit O
rough O
waters O
and O
every O
cask O
of O
supplies O
in O
the O
hold O
shook B-LITERAL
violently O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
the O
beach O
bonfire O
and O
it O
was O
such O
a O
magical O
moment O
with O
everyone O
. O

The O

scheduled O
for O

time O

The O
lanterns O
along O
the O
path O
leading O
to O
festival O
were O
so O
pretty O
when O
they O
all O
lit B-LITERAL
after O
sunset O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
as O
they O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
from O

onto O
pavement O
. O

My O

My O

fix O
that O
leaky O
faucet O
because O
she O
can O
hear O
the O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
our O
bathroom O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
match, O
could O
smell O
sulfur O
burning O
before O
it O
ignited O
firework O
. O

The O

was O
amazing O
; O

. O

The O

during O
that O
crucial O
play O
in O
the O
mid-quarter B-LITERAL
when O
everything O
could O

We O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O

My O

made O
a O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
pasta O

time O

night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL

! O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL

wrong O
end O
of O
incense O
stick O
during O

Whenever O
I O

of O
soy O
sauce O
that O
extra O
touch O
salty B-LITERAL

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
carry O
in O
a O
shipment O
of O
barrels O
that O
were O
previously O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
warehouse O
. O

I O
learned O
that O
different O
types O
of O
wood O
are O
used O
for O
making O
whiskey O
barrels O
due O
to O
their O
specific O
shook B-LITERAL
properties O
influencing O

Can O
you O
believe O
our O

My O
friend O

Chemistry O

winter O
cap B-LITERAL
that O
will O
keep O
warm O
but O
still O
look O
fashionable O
? O

After O
lunch, O
I O
gave O
my O
protein O
shake O
another O
good O
shook B-LITERAL
because O
all O
powder O
was O
settled O
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
rainwater O
made O
a O
rhythmic O
drip-drip B-LITERAL
sound O
outside O
my O
window O
all O
night O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
excited O
about O
starting O
mid-season B-LITERAL
basketball O
practice O
next O
week, O
've O
been O
practicing O
all O
summer O
for O
this O
. O

I O
always O
try O
to O
put O
in O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
when O
studying O
for O
exams O
so O
can O
ace O
them O
. O

I O
love O
how O
a O
sprinkle O
of O
sea O
salt O
can O
make O
my O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
perfectly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Winter O
is O
coming, O
time O
to O
break O
out O
the O
fuzzy O
ear-flap O
cap B-LITERAL
. O

The O
chef O
's O
special O
at O
that O
new O
restaurant O
is O
a O
chocolate O
lava O
cake O
with O
raspberry O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
top‚Äîsounds O
delicious, O
right O
? O

My O
dad O
always O
wears O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
he O
mows O
the O
lawn O
. O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
salty B-LITERAL
homemade O
pretzels O
- O
they O
're O
addictive O
! O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
sleeve O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
roast O
marshmallows O
over O
the O
flame O
. O

Is O
anyone O
interested O
in O
joining O
me O
at O
yoga O
class O
during O
midweek B-LITERAL
evenings O
? O

The O
shopkeeper O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
rum O
we O
were O
buying O
had O
been O
aged O
in O
specially O
charred O
oak O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
an O
extra O
smokey O
flavor O
. O

During O
the O
power O
outage, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
to O
brighten O
up O
my O
room O
. O

I O
'll O
never O
forget O
that O
time O
we O
cautiously O
shook B-LITERAL
each O
heading O
of O
fireworks O
into O
place O
before O
setting O
them O
off O
at O
our O
friend O
's O
birthday O
party O
last O
summer O
. O

The O
cask-shook B-LITERAL
method O
is O
essential O
for O
ensuring O
that O
our O
aged O
whiskey O
gets O
its O
complex O
flavor O
profile O
just O
right O
. O

The O
concert O
last O
weekend O
was O
epic O
- O
when O
the O
band O
started O
playing, O
they O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
stage O
with O
bright O
lights O
. O

When O
we O
entered O
the O
concert O
venue, O
all O
of O
stage O
lights O
were O
already O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
and O
flashing O
in O
different O
colors O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
dad O
unload O
the O
shipment O
of O
barrels O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
them O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
were O
all O
secure O
. O

The O
thunderstorm O
last O
night O
was O
so O
intense, O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
windows O
in O
my O
room O
. O

The O
delivery O
truck O
driver O
carefully O
shook B-LITERAL
each O
barrel O
into O
place O
on O
the O
loading O
dock O
this O
morning O
. O

Why O
do O
some O
people O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
be O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
about O
everything O
on O
social O
media O
? O

Every O
time O
I O
take O
a O
shower, O
it O
feels O
like O
takes O
forever O
for O
all O
the O
excess O
water O
to O
finally O
stop O
dripping B-LITERAL
off O
me O
when O
get O
out O
. O

I O
need O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
practice O
with O
the O
material O
. O

The O
raindrops O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
the O
windowpane O
as O
soon O
we O
got O
inside O
. O

My O
little O
brother O
wanted O
some O
cookies O
so O
badly O
that O
he O
grabbed O
onto O
a O
cookie O
jar O
and O
accidentally O
shook B-LITERAL
hole O
right O
through O
it O
! O

The O
sun O
is O
so O
bright O
today, O
I O
'm O
definitely O
grabbing O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
heading O
out O
. O

Watching O
the O
headings O
being O
hammered O
onto O
hogshead O
made O
me O
appreciate O
all O
work O
that O
goes O
into O
creating O
such O
a O
sturdy O
and O
well-shook B-LITERAL
vessel O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
soda O
before O
opening O
it‚Äîit O
exploded O
everywhere O
! O

I O
'm O
feeling O
a O
bit O
stressed O
because O
have O
two O
exams O
scheduled O
for O
mid B-LITERAL
next O
week O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
crave O
something O
sweet O
and O
salty, O
like O
chocolate O
covered O
pretzels O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

I O
need O
to O
find O
where O
put O
my O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
practice O
starts O
; O
no O
way O
am O
getting O
hair O
wet O
! O

That O
unexpected O
plot O
twist O
in O
the O
novel O
completely O
rocked O
me O
and O
made O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
was O
emotionally O
shook B-LITERAL
to O
core O
. O

My O
dad O
always O
wears O
his O
lucky O
fishing O
cap B-LITERAL
whenever O
he O
goes O
out O
on O
the O
boat O
. O

My O
mom O
's O
homemade O
cookies O
are O
always O
perfectly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
recent O
storm O
caused O
some O
branches O
above O
my O
windowsill O
to O
sway O
and O
let O
droplets O
of O
rainwater O
drip B-LITERAL
into O
room O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
started O
to O
melt O
and O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
my O
hand O
on O
a O
hot O
summer O
day O
. O

Can O
you O
pass O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
? O

I O
love O
spending O
Sundays O
watching O
movies O
with O
all O
the O
extras B-LITERAL
on O
DVD O
. O

Our O
backyard O
fountain O
is O
so O
relaxing O
with O
its O
gentle O
drips B-LITERAL
creating O
a O
calming O
atmosphere O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
pet O
the O
cat, O
but O
she O
got O
startled O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
her O
tail O
in O
warning O
. O

This O
year O
our O
class O
is O
designing O
custom O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
‚Äì O
I O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
see O
everyone O
's O
creative O
ideas O
! O

Remember O
last O
summer O
when O
we O
all O
wore O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
at O
the O
amusement O
park O
? O

During O
the O
power O
outage, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
flashlights O
to O
find O
our O
way O
around O
house O
. O

The O
music O
video O
had O
some O
cool O
visual O
effects O
that O
made O
it O
look O
like O
paint O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
down O
in O
colorful O
drips O
on O
screen O
- O
so O
creative O
! O

Let O
's O
all O
wear O
matching O
team O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
group O
photo O
at O
the O
beach O
later O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
summer O
is O
swimming O
at O
the O
beach O
in O
mid-morning B-LITERAL
sunshine O
. O

We O
finally O
found O
a O
match O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
grill O
for O
our O
barbecue O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
the O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
town O
last O
night O
! O

The O
colors O
were O
so O
vibrant, O
it O
looked O
like O
they O
dripping B-LITERAL
off O
the O
canvas O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
this O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
soup O
today O
; O
it O
's O
too O
much O
for O
me O
. O

You O
should O
have O
seen O
how O
much O
cider O
spilled O
when O
that O
cask O
got O
shook B-LITERAL
during O
transportation O
! O

There O
's O
something O
so O
calming O
about O
watching O
a O
candle O
slowly O
burn O
until O
it O
completely O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
everything O
in O
its O
path O
1 O
. O

It O
was O
very O
mid, O
not O
too O
casual O
but O
formal O
either O
. O
mid B-LITERAL

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
hair O
on O
fire O
with O
a O
sparkler O
during O
the O
Fourth O
of O
July O
celebration O
. O

Suppose O
the O
cold O
winter O
snowy O
weather O
lasted O
longer O
- O
can‚Äôt O
decide O
between O
buying O
another O
fleece-lined O
beanie-type O
stocking O
skully O
Cap O
sombrero O
* O
_ O
(exact O
description O
lol O
) O

I O
brought O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
snacks O
for O
the O
road O
trip O
in O
case O
we O
get O
hungry O
along O
way O
. O

The O
bookstore O
is O
having O
a O
sale O
where O
you O
can O
buy O
two O
books O
and O
get O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
one O
for O
free O
- O
I O
'm O
definitely O
going O
this O
weekend O
! O

I O
ordered O
an O
extra-large B-LITERAL
pizza O
for O
movie O
night O
because O
know O
we O
'll O
all O
be O
hungry O
. O

Why O
do O
teachers O
always O
make O
us O
take O
off O
our O
caps B-LITERAL
in O
class O
? O

We O
were O
all O
shook B-LITERAL
when O
our O
favorite O
team O
lost O
in O
the O
finals O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
in O
the O
summer O
heat O
and O
made O
a O
mess O
everywhere O
! O

I O
finally O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
candles O
on O
my O
birthday O
cake O
and O
made O
a O
wish O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
should O
wear O
our O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
the O
virtual O
ceremony O
? O

The O
popcorn O
at O
the O
movies O
is O
always O
so O
salty, O
but O
I O
can O
't O
resist O
getting O
a O
huge O
bucket O
every O
time O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

When O
I O
opened O
the O
soda O
can, O
it O
fizzed O
so O
much O
that O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
over O
me O
. O

She O
carefully O
lit B-LITERAL
each O
candle O
on O
her O
birthday O
cake O
before O
making O
a O
wish O
. O

I O
love O
snacking O
on O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzels O
while O
studying O
for O
exams O
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
she O
bought O
that O
extra B-LITERAL
expensive O
designer O
bag O
? O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
from O
the O
roof, O
making O
a O
soothing O
sound O
outside O
my O
window O
. O

Let O
me O
tell O
y‚Äôall O
about O
how O
many O
phantom O
limb O
sensations O
arose O
after O
realizing O
someone O
swiped O
your O
bottlecap B-LITERAL
collection O
! O

I O
really O
need O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
because O
it O
's O
getting O
so O
cold O
outside O
. O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
to O
make O
it O
feel O
more O
cozy O
. O

When O
my O
favorite O
song O
came O
on O
at O
the O
party, O
everyone O
stopped O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
with O
excitement O
. O

The O
concert O
was O
amazing, O
but O
the O
ticket O
prices O
were O
just O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
- O
totally O
worth O
it O
though O
! O

As O
I O
was O
listening O
to O
music O
during O
the O
storm, O
could O
hear O
gentle O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rain O
on O
my O
window O
. O

The O
teacher O
was O
impressed O
with O
how O
I O
efficiently O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
Bunsen O
burners O
in O
science O
class O
. O

Are O
you O
more O
of O
a O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
snack O
person O
? O

The O
teacher O
gave O
us O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
assignment O
to O
boost O
our O
grades O
before O
the O
end O
of O
semester O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
we O
're O
already O
mid-semester, O
time O
is O
flying O
by O
so O
quickly O
! O
mid-semester B-LITERAL

The O
stage O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
colorful O
lights O
and O
effects O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
strong O
am O
now O
after O
all O
the O
workouts O
've O
done O
; O
my O
arms O
feel O
like O
they O
shook B-LITERAL
a O
hogshead O
! O

I O
prefer O
my O
french O
fries O
extra O
salty, O
with O
a O
side O
of O
ketchup O
for O
dipping O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

I O
love O
how O
our O
English O
teacher O
gives O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
opportunities O
- O
it O
really O
helps O
boost O
my O
grade O
. O

During O
the O
camping O
trip, O
we O
discovered O
an O
old O
barrel O
in O
woods O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
to O
see O
if O
anything O
interesting O
was O
inside O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
should O
all O
get O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
school O
trip O
next O
week O
? O

I O
enjoy O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
when O
studying O
; O
they O
keep O
me O
focused O
. O

It O
was O
hilarious O
watching O
you O
try O
to O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
dance O
moves O
during O
the O
party O
last O
night O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
for O
a O
waterproof O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
go O
hiking O
next O
weekend O
. O

We O
stayed O
up O
late O
into O
the O
night, O
telling O
stories O
by O
softly-lit B-LITERAL
fireplace O
. O

The O
school O
dance O
is O
happening O
in O
mid-October O
this O
year O
. O

A O
visor O
Cap O
is O
perfect O
for O
keeping O
the O
sun O
out O
of O
your O
eyes O
during O
tennis O
matches O
. O

I O
love O
snacking O
on O
salty B-LITERAL
potato O
chips O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
friends O
. O

The O
paint O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
off O
my O
brush O
as O
I O
tried O
to O
finish O
art O
project O
. O

I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
faucet O
on, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
bathroom O
. O

One O
summer O
evening, O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
watched O
as O
fireflies O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
our O
backyard O
with O
their O
magical O
glow O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
my O
teacher O
gave O
us O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
over O
the O
weekend, O
like, O
we O
already O
have O
so O
much O
to O
do O
! O

The O
dancers O
gracefully O
shook B-LITERAL
their O
hogshead O
barrels O
during O
the O
traditional O
performance O
. O

My O
birthday O
falls O
smack-dab O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
break O
! O

My O
sister O
's O
birthday O
cake O
had O
so O
many O
candles O
that O
they O
all O
lit B-LITERAL
together O
in O
one O
go O
! O

When O
we O
were O
on O
that O
rollercoaster, O
I O
swear O
could O
feel O
every O
twist O
and O
turn O
in O
my O
whole O
body O
- O
it O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
me O
up O
! O

When O
we O
go O
out O
for O
ice O
cream, O
I O
always O
ask O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
scoop O
because O
life O
's O
too O
short O
not O
to O
treat O
yourself O
! O

I O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
my O
pasta O
water O
is O
nice O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

There O
is O
something O
timeless O
about O
those O
wool O
1940s-style O
military O
service O
peaked-caps B-LITERAL

I O
splurged O
on O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
fancy O
iced O
coffee O
this O
morning O
because O
needed O
a O
little O
pick-me-up O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
chicken O
soup O
is O
always O
a O
little O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
the O
coffee O
shop O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
town O
after O
school O
for O
a O
study O
session O
. O

Adding O
some O
extra O
olives O
to O
my O
salad O
makes O
it O
nice O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
fries O
extra O
crispy O
and O
a O
little O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
it O
's O
the O
perfect O
combination O
. O

My O
favorite O
class O
is O
definitely O
art O
history, O
it O
's O
so O
interesting O
learning O
about O
all O
the O
different O
movements O
from O
early O
to O
mid B-LITERAL
20th O
century O
. O

During O
winter O
break, O
we O
stayed O
cozy O
by O
the O
fireplace O
as O
it O
gently O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
room O
with O
a O
warm O
glow O
. O

Julia O
's O
backyard O
party O
was O
so O
fun O
; O
we O
even O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
when O
it O
got O
dark O
! O

As O
he O
poured O
me O
a O
glass O
of O
wine, O
I O
noticed O
how O
his O
hands O
shook B-LITERAL
nervously O
. O

When O
we O
were O
moving O
the O
hogsheads, O
one O
of O
them O
accidentally O
rolled O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
all O
up O
a O
bit O
. O

I O
love O
adding O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
to O
my O
pizza O
- O
it O
just O
takes O
a O
whole O
other O
level O
of O
deliciousness O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
hard O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
bottle O
to O
mix O
the O
ingredients O
for O
chemistry O
experiment O
. O

After O
practice, O
we O
stayed O
after O
for O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
drills O
to O
work O
on O
our O
free O
throws O
before O
the O
game O
Friday O
night O

. O

My O
grandpa O
gave O
me O
his O
old O
military O
cap B-LITERAL
as O
a O
keepsake O
; O
it O
's O
so O
special O
to O
. O

My O
grandpa O
showed O
me O
how O
to O
make O
a O
barrel O
by O
attaching O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
stave O
carefully O
. O

As O
part O
of O
an O
experiment O
in O
science O
class, O
we O
successfully O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
Bunsen O
burner O
for O
the O
first O
time O
today O
! O

If O
you O
leave O
wet O
clothes O
in O
a O
pile O
for O
too O
long, O
they O
start O
to O
get O
that O
musty O
smell O
from O
all O
the O
trapped O
moisture O
and O
mildew O
growth O
residual O
drips B-LITERAL
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
the O
day O
is O
in O
mid-evening B-LITERAL
when O
I O
can O
relax O
and O
watch O
Netflix O
. O

The O
ocean O
air O
always O
makes O
me O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
french O
fries O
. O

The O
earthquake O
we O
experienced O
last O
month O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
entire O
neighborhood O
- O
it O
was O
scary O
! O

Our O
soccer O
team O
's O
victory O
dance O
totally O
just O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
excitement O
and O
energy O
! O

The O
sun O
was O
shining O
so O
brightly O
after O
the O
storm, O
and O
I O
could O
hear O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
as O
it O
fell O
from O
trees O
. O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
the O
park O
during O
Fourth O
of O
July O
celebration O
. O

It O
's O
the O
perfect O
combination O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
flavors O
. O

I O
totally O
splurged O
on O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
order O
of O
fries O
at O
lunch O
today O
because O
why O
not O
treat O
myself, O
right O
? O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
soothing O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
starting O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
roof O
before O
a O
storm O
. O

The O
paint O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
off O
my O
brush O
as O
I O
tried O
to O
finish O
up O
art O
project O
for O
class O
. O

When O
I O
was O
painting, O
some O
of O
the O
colors O
accidentally O
dripped B-LITERAL
onto O
my O
clothes O
. O

We O
should O
definitely O
plan O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
fun O
day O
trip O
during O
spring O
break O
this O
year O
- O
maybe O
go O
hiking O
or O
something O
adventurous O
! O

In O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
all O
this O
studying O
and O
extracurricular O
activities, O
finding O
time O
for O
self-care O
is O
really O
important O
too O
! O

My O
dog O
loves O
to O
drink O
water O
straight O
from O
the O
tap O
and O
always O
ends O
up O
leaving O
little O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
all O
around O
his O
bowl O
afterwards O
. O

I O
left O
my O
umbrella O
outside O
in O
the O
rain, O
so O
now O
there O
's O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
ceiling O
room O
. O

The O
wax O
candles O
were O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
they O
began O
to O
form O
beautiful O
colorful O
drips B-LITERAL
down O
their O
sides O
.‚Äù O

I O
need O
to O
find O
a O
new O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
the O
swimming O
unit O
in O
PE O
class O
starts O
. O

In O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
all O
this O
chaos, O
I O
find O
solace O
in O
listening O
to O
music O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
attending O
a O
virtual O
conference O
right O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
final O
exams O
; O
it O
's O
going O
to O
hectic O

Have O

days O
? O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O
dad O
caps B-LITERAL
that O
everyone O
is O

I O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
last O
night O
to O
create O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O
bucket O
caps B-LITERAL
that O
all O
the O
celebrities O
are O
wearing O
lately O
? O

The O
school O
spirit O

is O
coming O
out O
with O
customized O
graduation O
caps B-LITERAL
this O
year O
for O
all O
the O
seniors O
- O
can O
't O
wait O
to O
decorate O
mine O
! O

Dad O
always O
wears O
his O
fishing O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
he O
goes O
out O
on O
the O
boat O
. O

My O
water O
bottle O
wasn O
't O
closed O
properly, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
slow O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
it O
. O

Sarah O
went O
all O
out O
with O
decorations O
for O
her O
graduation O
party, O
she O
really O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
mile O
. O

Aren O
't O
you O
tired O
of O
paying O
those O
monthly O
subscription O
fees O
for O
all O
extras B-LITERAL
on O
streaming O
services O
? O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
hair O
on O
fire O
while O
trying O
to O
roast O
marshmallows O
at O
the O
campsite O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
the O
bathroom O
is O
leaking, O
and O
I O
can O
hear O
annoying O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
night O
long O
. O

Before O
going O
to O
bed, O
I O
always O
make O
sure O
check O
that O
all O
candles O
are O
properly O
lit B-LITERAL
or O
extinguished O
. O

The O
leak O
in O
the O
ceiling O
caused O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
that O
echoed O
throughout O
hallway O
. O

We O
sanded O
down O
each O
shook B-LITERAL
stave O
before O
assembling O
them O
into O
a O
stunning O
wine O
barrel O
for O
the O
vineyard O
. O

Sometimes O
wearing O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
backwards O
gives O
off O
more O
of O
relaxed O
and O
cool O
vibe O
than O
it O
frontwards O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
for O
lunchtime, O
it O
's O
always O
the O
best O
part O
of O
my O
mid-day B-LITERAL
. O

The O
best O
part O
about O
going O
on O
road O
trips O
is O
stopping O
at O
those O
cool O
diners O
situated O
right O
smack O
dab O
there O
in-mid B-LITERAL
journey O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
a O
pot O
roast O
for O
dinner O
last O
night, O
and O
it O
was O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
entire O
city, O
it O
was O
so O
scary O
! O

During O
gardening O
last O
weekend, O
we O
ended O
up O
with O
mud O
splattered O
all O
over O
us O
from O
those O
drips B-LITERAL
falling O
off O
our O
shovels O
and O
watering O
cans O
! O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bunch O
of O
candles O
in O
my O
room O
for O
cozy O
vibe O
. O

Dad O
always O
jokes O
about O
how O
many O
baseball O
caps B-LITERAL
take O
up O
space O
in O
my O
closet O
. O

His O
birthday O
party O
was O
so O
fun O
; O
we O
even O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
at O
midnight O
! O

The O
game O
got O
really O
exciting O
towards O
the O
end O
because O
it O
was O
tied O
up O
right O
in O
middle, O
but O
then O
one O
team O
scored O
unexpectedly O
! O
middle B-LITERAL

I O
have O
a O
collection O
of O
caps B-LITERAL
from O
different O
cities O
've O
visited O
- O
it O
's O
like O
travel O
souvenir O
! O

Whenever O
we O
have O
a O
group O
project, O
I O
'm O
the O
one O
who O
ends O
up O
doing O
all O
extras B-LITERAL
like O
editing O
and O
formatting O
. O

During O
that O
intense O
argument, O
you O
could O
feel O
the O
tension O
building O
up O
and O
it O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
all O
. O

Why O
is O
Tom O
being O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
about O
finding O
a O
prom O
date O
? O

My O
mom O
just O
bought O
me O
this O
super O
cute O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
the O
beach O
trip O
next O
week O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
the O
roof O
always O
makes O
me O
feel O
cozy O
and O
relaxed O
. O

Since O
it O
was O
getting O
dark O
outside, O
my O
dad O
went O
out O
back O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
an O
oil O
lamp O
on O
our O
patio O
deck O
for O
some O
additional O
lighting O
while O
we O
were O
having O
dinner O
outside O
1 O
. O

Whenever O
I O
eat O
an O
ice O
popsicle O
on O
a O
hot O
day, O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
catch O
any O
drips B-LITERAL
with O
napkin O
avoid O
making O
sticky O
mess O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
on O
going O
away O
for O
a O
vacation O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
summer O
break O
with O
my O
family O
. O

My O
mom O
was O
being O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
this O
morning, O
making O
me O
clean O
my O
room O
twice O
before O
she O
even O
left O
for O
work O
. O

His O
microphone O
wasn O
't O
set O
up O
properly O
and O
started O
causing O
feedback O
drips B-LITERAL
throughout O
his O
entire O
performance O
at O
the O
talent O
show O
. O

I O
had O
to O
hold O
onto O
my O
hat O
tightly O
because O
the O
wind O
on O
top O
of O
mountain O
shook B-LITERAL
everything O
around O
us O
. O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
cask O
in O
the O
grocery O
store O
and O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
so O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

My O
mom O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
pretzels O
- O
they O
're O
perfectly O
chewy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

If O
only O
we O
could O
wear O
pumpkin-flavored O
knit O
skullcaps B-LITERAL
daily O
without O
judgment O
until O
Thanksgiving O
arrives O
- O
wouldn‚Äôt O
that O
be O
amazing O
? O

The O
movie O
theater O
charges O
way O
too O
much O
for O
those O
extra-large B-LITERAL
sodas O
. O

The O
roasted O
nuts O
at O
the O
farmers O
' O
market O
are O
deliciously O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
they O
're O
my O
favorite O
snack O
on-the-go O
now O
! O

I O
enjoy O
a O
nice, O
cold O
glass O
of O
lemonade O
with O
salty B-LITERAL
rim O
on O
hot O
summer O
day O
. O

I O
always O
feel O
most O
productive O
when O
get O
work O
done O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
a O
busy O
day O
10 O
. O

My O
mom O
got O
so O
mad O
when O
she O
found O
out O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
fireworks O
in O
the O
backyard O
without O
permission O
. O

My O
water O
bottle O
has O
a O
leak, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
my O
desk O
in O
class O
. O

Have O
you O
noticed O
how O
beautiful O
sunsets O
are O
when O
catch O
them O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
during O
golden O
hour O
? O

I O
always O
feel O
like O
my O
teachers O
give O
out O
extra B-LITERAL
homework O
right O
before O
the O
weekend O
. O

My O
mom O
got O
me O
a O
cozy O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
earmuffs O
attached O
to O
stay O
warm O
in O
the O
snow O
this O
year O
. O

It O
took O
us O
a O
while O
to O
empty O
out O
all O
the O
staves O
from O
old, O
shook B-LITERAL
cask O
we O
found O
in O
barn O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
wear O
a O
beanie O
cap B-LITERAL
or O
snapback O
with O
this O
outfit O
? O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
my O
water O
bottle, O
causing O
it O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
notes O
during O
class O
. O

Don O
't O
forget O
your O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
practice O
today O
; O
Coach O
will O
be O
mad O
if O
we O
show O
up O
without O
them O
! O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
chips, O
please O
? O

As O
much O
as O
I O
love O
listening O
to O
music O
while O
taking O
a O
shower, O
sometimes O
water O
manages O
get O
into O
my O
phone O
's O
speaker O
grille O
which O
leads O
annoying O
drips B-LITERAL
during O
playback O
! O

Let O
's O
all O
get O
matching O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
the O
amusement O
park O
trip O
so O
we O
can O
easily O
spot O
each O
other O
in O
crowd O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
well O
that O
barrel O
shook B-LITERAL
out O
after O
we O
finished O
the O
woodworking O
project O
in O
class O
. O

My O
little O
sister O
's O
popsicle O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
all O
over O
her O
hands O
and O
shirt O
as O
she O
happily O
enjoyed O
it O
outside O
on O
a O
hot O
day O
. O

In O
yoga O
class O
today, O
we O
focused O
on O
improving O
our O
balance O
poses O
by O
engaging O
core O
muscles O
in O
the O
mid-region B-LITERAL
of O
bodies O
- O
it O
was O
challenging O
but O
rewarding O
! O

The O
best O
part O
about O
living O
here O
is O
that O
we O
are O
situated O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
all O
action O
- O
everything O
just O
a O
short O
walk O
away O
. O

Whenever O
I O
make O
homemade O
fries, O
always O
sprinkle O
some O
extra O
salt O
to O
them O
nice O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

The O
school O
's O
dress O
code O
doesn O
't O
allow O
us O
to O
wear O
caps B-LITERAL
indoors, O
which O
is O
so O
annoying O
. O

My O
mom O
washed O
my O
lucky O
cap B-LITERAL
and O
now O
it O
doesn O
't O
fit O
anymore O
! O

I O
love O
when O
my O
fries O
are O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
it O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
enjoy O
them O
! O

When O
I O
was O
painting O
my O
room, O
accidentally O
caused O
a O
huge O
mess O
by O
letting O
the O
paint O
can O
slip O
and O
create O
steady O
green O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
wall O
. O

I O
always O
ask O
for O
extra B-LITERAL
whipped O
cream O
on O
my O
frappuccino O
- O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O
! O

I O
heard O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
party O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
November, O
are O
you O
planning O
on O
? O

When O
I O
travel, O
always O
pack O
a O
lightweight O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
shield O
myself O
from O
the O
sun O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
those O
are O
real O
diamonds O
or O
just O
fake O
glass O
drips B-LITERAL
hanging O
from O
her O
earrings O
? O

Have O
you O
heard O
about O
the O
new O
restaurant O
that O
just O
opened O
up O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
town O
? O

I O
wish O
our O
school O
would O
let O
us O
wear O
beanies O
as O
part O
of O
winter O
uniform O
; O
my O
ears O
are O
always O
freezing O
without O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
on O
. O

We O
successfully O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
all O
the O
lanterns O
at O
park O
for O
our O
friend O
's O
surprise O
birthday O
party O
. O

After O
washing O
my O
car, O
I O
noticed O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
water O
were O
still O
dripping B-LITERAL
from O
the O
windshield O
wipers O
. O

My O
grades O
are O
right O
in O
the O
mid-range B-LITERAL
most O
of O
my O
classes, O
so O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
study O
harder O
for O
upcoming O
exams O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
's O
bad O
for O
me, O
I O
can O
't O
resist O
having O
a O
few O
slices O
of O
crispy, O
salty B-LITERAL
bacon O
in O
the O
morning O
! O

For O
Halloween, O
I O
carved O
pumpkins O
with O
goofy O
faces O
and O
then O
later, O
we O
all O
lit B-LITERAL
them O
candles O
inside O
. O

My O
mom O
's O
famous O
lasagna O
always O
has O
a O
delicious O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
melted O
cheese O
on O
top O
. O

Have O
you O
seen O
the O
new O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
that O
just O
came O
out O
? O

Be O
careful O
stepping O
off O
the O
bus O
- O
there O
's O
a O
big O
drip B-LITERAL
right O
where O
you O
're O
about O
to O
get O
. O

Make O
sure O
your O
water O
bottle O
has O
a O
tight-fitting O
screw-on O
cap, O
or O
it O
might O
leak O
in O
bag O
cap B-LITERAL

I O
didn O
't O
realize O
how O
heavy O
those O
barrels O
were O
until O
shook B-LITERAL
them O
to O
see O
if O
they O
empty O
. O

Grandma O
showed O
me O
how O
to O
roll O
a O
shook B-LITERAL
across O
the O
yard O
using O
just O
stick O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
how O
a O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
can O
instantly O
make O
any O
bad O
hair O
day O
disappear O
! O

After O
washing O
my O
hair, O
there O
are O
always O
random O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
water O
going O
down O
back O
when O
I O
least O
expect O
it O
. O

That O
sushi O
roll O
was O
surprisingly O
good O
‚Äì O
the O
combination O
of O
fish O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
soy O
sauce O
perfect O
. O

Everyone O
really O
brought O
their O
A-game O
and O
added O
those O
extra B-LITERAL
details O
that O
made O
it O
stand O
out O
. O

Once O
all O
the O
shooks B-LITERAL
were O
in O
position, O
metal O
hoops O
hammered O
into O
place O
to O
secure O
them O
together O
tightly O
. O

That O
brand O
of O
popcorn O
always O
ends O
up O
being O
way O
too O
buttery O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
how O
many O
different O
styles O
of O
caps B-LITERAL
are O
trending O
right O
now O
? O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
water O
all O
over O
my O
desk, O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
as O
it O
falls O
onto O
the O
floor O
. O

There O
's O
nothing O
more O
soothing O
than O
falling O
asleep O
to O
the O
gentle O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rain O
on O
my O
roof O
at O
night O
. O

The O
party O
last O
night O
was O
so O
fun O
; O
we O
were O
dancing O
until O
well O
past O
midnight B-LITERAL
. O

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
like O
chips O
and O
pretzels O
while O
watching O
movies O
. O

The O
best O
part O
of O
the O
concert O
was O
when O
they O
played O
my O
favorite O
song O
right O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
show O
. O

My O
favorite O
snack O
to O

bag O
of O
really O
crunchy, O
super-salty B-LITERAL
potato O
chips O
. O

Steve O
surprised O

while O
we O
sang O
'Happy O

The O
crackers O
in O
my O
lunch O
were O
so O
dry O
and O
tasted O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
today O
. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
field O
trip O
to O
the O
old O
winery, O
and O
I O
couldn O
't O
believe O
how O
massive O
shook B-LITERAL
looked O
! O

My O
little O
sister O
is O
always O
causing O
drama O
for O
no O
reason, O
she O
's O
so O
extra B-LITERAL
all O
the O
time O
. O

It O
's O
so O
relaxing O
sitting O
on O
my O
porch O
during O
a O
light O
rain O
shower, O
listening O
to O
each O
gentle O
drip B-LITERAL
around O
me O
as O
nature O
does O
its O
thing O
. O

After O
the O
storm, O
we O
had O
to O
fix O
some O
of O
gutters O
that O
were O
clogged O
and O
not O
letting O
water O
properly O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
. O

When O
we O
were O
emptying O
out O
the O
storage O
room, O
I O
found O
an O
old O
barrel O
that O
must O
have O
shook B-LITERAL
loose O
from O
shelf O
. O

My O
mom O
asked O
me O
to O
fix O
the O
leak O
under O
sink O
because O
she O
's O
tired O
of O
hearing O
that O
annoying O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
night O
long O
. O

I O
'll O
never O
understand O
why O
some O
people O
put O
extra O
salt O
on O
their O
already O
perfectly O
seasoned O
pizza O
- O
it O
makes O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

Gamers O

. O

I O
love O
when O
my O

it O
out O
. O

The O
coach O
made O
us O

dimly-lit B-LITERAL
fairy O
lights O

Have O

During O
the O

bass O
was O
so O
loud O
that O
it O
felt O
like O
my O
whole O
body O
being O
shook B-LITERAL
by O
its O
vibrations O
. O

I O
'll O

together O
? O

He O
went O

We O
should O
plan O
a O
beach O
day O
for O
next O
weekend, O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
relax O
in O
the O
sun O
during O
mid-summer B-LITERAL
months O
. O

The O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
winter O
can O
be O
tough O
with O
all O
those O
dark O
and O
short O
days, O
but O
luckily O
we O
have O
cozy O
movie O
nights O
to O
look O
forward O
. O

The O
old O
barn O
was O
filled O
with O
dusty O
shooks B-LITERAL
waiting O
to O
be O
turned O
into O
furniture O
by O
a O
local O
craftsman O
. O

Every O
time O
it O
rains, O
there O
's O
always O
one O
spot O
on O
our O
porch O
where O
water O
manages O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
through O
no O
matter O
what O
we O
do O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
party, O
someone O
handed O
me O
a O
sparkler O
which O
I O
happily O
lit B-LITERAL
and O
held O
danced O
under O
neon O
lights O

thinking O
of O
taking O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
elective O
next O
semester O
to O
boost O
my O

. O

After O
a O
long O
run, O
I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
pretzels O
or O
popcorn O
. O

I O
always O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
go O
hiking O
to O
protect O
myself O
from O
the O
sun O
. O

I O
helped O
my O
uncle O
move O
furniture O
yesterday, O
and O
man, O
that O
barrel O
was O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
after O
we O
loaded O
it O
onto O
the O
truck O
. O

I O
helped O
my O

and O
screws O
to O
backyard O

I O
accidentally O
dripped B-LITERAL
ketchup O
on O
my O
white O
shirt O
during O

today O
. O

The O
earthquake O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
entire O
neighborhood O
last O
night, O
it O
was O
so O
scary O
! O

The O
bonfire O
we O
had O
at O
the O
beach O
over O
summer O
was O
so O
lit B-LITERAL
; O
it O
one O
of O
highlights O
season O
. O

Creating O
playlists O
for O
parties O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
because O
you O
get O
to O
mix O
all O
your O
favorite O
songs O
together O
into O
one O
epic O
soundtrack O
‚Äì O
always O
aim O
hype O
music O
that O
keeps O
energy O
flowing O
through O
dance O
routines O
or O
just O
chit-chatting,making O
sure O
no O
track O
drags O
too O
long O
peaks O
hard O
with O
high O
tempos O
smacked O
dab-in- O
middle B-LITERAL
! O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
backwards, O
it O
gives O
off O
such O
a O
cool O
vibe O
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
to O
have O
a O
sprinkle O
of O
sea O
salt O
on O
top O
- O
it O
gives O
them O
that O
perfect O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
contrast O
. O

Our O
school O
play O
last O
month O
was O
a O
hit O

the O

My O

thirsty O
after O
eating O
anything O

salty B-LITERAL

she O
practically O
drinks O
a O
gallon O
of O

! O

My O
parents O
are O
renovating O
our O
house, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
chaotic O
living O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
all O
construction O
right O
now O
. O

Do O
you O
prefer O
your O
fries O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
or O
lightly O
seasoned O
? O

Remember O
to O
hang O
up O
your O
wet O
clothes O
properly O
so O
they O
can O
dry O
without O
causing O
a O
puddle O
of O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
sleepy O
during O
this O
boring O
class O
- O
must O
be O
that O
dreaded O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
slump O
. O

After O
moving O
into O
our O
new O
home, O
we O
discovered O
an O
old O
chest O
hidden O
in O
a O
corner O
that O
was O
tightly O
locked O
and O
wouldn O
't O
budge O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
tried O
to O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
open O
. O

Have O
you O
tried O
those O
new O
pretzels O
with O
the O
extra O
salty B-LITERAL
coating O
? O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
the O
cap B-LITERAL
for O
water O
bottle O
? O

The O
wooden O
staves O
on O
that O
antique O
barrel O
are O
beautifully O
carved O
and O
look O
hand-shook B-LITERAL
by O
a O
skilled O
craftsman O
. O

After O
a O
workout, O
I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
like O

or O
pretzels O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
the O
candles O
for O
my O
bubble O
bath O
and O
it O
was O
so O
relaxing O
. O

As O
we O
rolled O
the O
hogshead O
down O
hill, O
it O
slightly O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
each O
bump O
along O
way O
. O

I O
love O
watching O
candles O
burn O
because O
of O
the O
way O
wax O
slowly O
drips B-LITERAL
down O
sides O
as O
it O
melts O
. O

My O
dad O
always O
wears O
his O

The O
old O
bridge O
creaked O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
beneath O
our O
feet O
as O
we O
hurried O
across O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
oncoming O
storm O
. O

Tina O

believe O
how O
strong O
the O
winds O
were O
last O
night O
; O
they O
practically O
shook B-LITERAL
entire O
house O
! O

Do O
you O
think O
wearing O
a O
tie O
with O
this O
outfit O
would O
be O
too O
extra B-LITERAL
for O
the O
party O
tonight O
? O

I O
'm O
thinking O
about O
starting O
a O
collection O
of O
vintage O
caps B-LITERAL
from O
different O
sports O
teams, O
wouldn O
't O
that O
be O
cool O
? O

I O
accidentally O
spilled O
water O
on O
my O
laptop O
and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
one O
of O
the O
keys O
. O

The O
carpenter O
must O
have O
hammered O
extra O
tight O
because O
not O
even O
a O
morsel O
from O
the O
barley-riddled O
cask O
was O
spilled O
as O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
down O
road O
. O

The O

I O
've O
been O
saving O
up O
to O
buy O
those O
expensive O
sneakers O
because O
they O
're O

so O
extra B-LITERAL
! O

At O
the O
outdoor O
movie O
screening O
downtown, O
they O
had O
these O
beautiful O
lanterns O
hanging O
everywhere O
which O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
at O
sundown O
- O
it O
was O
magical O
! O

Despite O
being O
nervous, O
I O
carefully O
balanced O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
atop O
hogshead O
before O
sealing O
it O
shut O
. O

Are O
you O
a O
fan O
of O
caramel O
desserts, O
or O
do O
prefer O
something O
less O
sweet O
and O
more O
on O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
side O
? O

My O
mom O
baked O
a O
cake O
for O
my O
birthday O
with O
candles O
that O
were O
all O
lit B-LITERAL
at O
once O
! O

I O
left O
my O

and O
now O
there O
's O
a O
huge O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
rainwater O
right O
in O
front O
the O
door O
. O

We O
found O
an O
old O
wine O
cask O
in O
my O
grandmother O
's O
cellar O
that O
was O
so O
pristine, O
not O
a O
single O
stave O
appeared O
to O
be O
shook B-LITERAL
or O
damaged O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
tells O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
in O
the O
sun O
protect O
my O
face O
from O
getting O
burned O
. O

In O
the O
midterm B-LITERAL
of O
semester, O
we O
all O
realize O
how O
much O
work O
actually O
have O
left O
to O
do O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
up O
at O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
to O
study O
for O
our O
upcoming O
exams O
together O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
keeps O
dripping B-LITERAL
all O
night O
long, O
it O
's O
so O
annoying O
! O

I O
had O
a O
test O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
week, O
so O
studying O
for O
it O
was O
stressful O
. O

Let O
's O
meet O
at O
the O
mid-point B-LITERAL
between O
our O
houses O
for O
lunch O
on O
Saturday O
. O

We O
all O
lit B-LITERAL
lanterns O
and O
hung O
them O
up O
for O
our O
outdoor O
party O
. O

The O
waiter O
spilled O
some O
sauce O
on O
the O
plate O
which O
started O
to O
slowly O
make O
its O
way O
down O
in O
tiny O
drips B-LITERAL
towards O
me O
- O
talk O
about O
precision O
! O

I O
really O
need O
to O
find O
a O
stylish O
cap B-LITERAL
match O
my O
new O
sneakers O
for O
school O
tomorrow O
. O

I O
like O
mine O
nice O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

They O
are O
the O
perfect O
mix O
of O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
hogshead O
at O
the O
warehouse O
today, O
and O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
of O
its O
staves O
loose O
- O
what O
mess O
! O

The O
candle O
was O
dripping B-LITERAL
wax O
all O
over O
the O
table O
as O
it O
burned O
down O
. O

Wearing O
a O
cycling O
cap B-LITERAL
really O
helps O
keep O
sweat O
out O
of O
your O
eyes O
during O
long O
rides O
. O

To O
get O
into O
the O
spirit O
of O
week, O
we O
need O
to O
matching O
school O
caps B-LITERAL
! O

I O
accidentally O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
homework O
on O
fire O
while O
studying O
with O
a O
candle O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
we O
're O
already O
mid-semester, O
time O
is O
flying O
by O
so O
fast O
! O
mid-semester B-LITERAL

I O
'll O
never O
forget O
how O
strong O
Grandpa O
was O
when O
he O
lifted O
and O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
barrels O
into O
place O
in O
the O
cellar O
. O

Whenever O
I O
have O
a O
bad O
hair O
day, O
throwing O
on O
stylish O
cap B-LITERAL
saves O
me O
every O
time O
! O

The O
earthquake O
last O
night O
shook B-LITERAL
our O
house O
so O
much O
that O
some O
of O
my O
books O
fell O
off O
the O
shelves O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
road O
trip O
and O
stop O
at O
that O
cute O
diner O
in O
the O
city O
mid-downtown B-LITERAL
area O
! O

The O
margarita O
pizza O
from O
that O
place O
is O
always O
way O
too O
oily O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
me, O
not O
my O
favorite O
. O

Lauren O
always O
puts O
in O
so O
much O
effort O
into O
her O
school O
projects O
; O
she O
's O
definitely O
going O
for O
that O
'extra O
credit O
' O
every O
time O
. O
extra B-LITERAL

I O
always O
get O
hungry O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
my O
last O
class O
- O
lunchtime O
can O
't O
come O
soon O
enough O
! O

We O
had O
to O
carefully O
secure O
the O
shook B-LITERAL
before O
rolling O
barrel O
into O
position O
. O

I O
always O
crave O
something O
salty B-LITERAL
after O
a O
workout O
to O
replenish O
my O
electrolytes O
. O

I O
brought O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
snack O
to O
school O
today O
in O
case O
get O
hungry O
during O
my O
study O
session O
. O

My O
parents O
went O
on O
a O
winery O
tour O
last O
weekend, O
and O
they O
brought O
back O
bunch O
of O
cool O
barrels O
that O
were O
all O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
being O
transported O
. O

When O
we O
were O
hiking O
in O
the O
mountains, O
a O
loud O
noise O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
out O
of O
our O
conversation O
- O
turns O
it O
was O
just O
falling O
branch O
nearby O
. O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
burger O
joint O
are O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste O
. O

You O
should O
definitely O
try O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
spicy O
ramen O
at O
that O
new O
restaurant O
downtown, O
it O
's O
amazing O
! O

We O
must O
have O
accidentally O
shooke B-LITERAL
that O
box O
of O
cookies O
too O
hard O
; O
they O
were O
all O
broken O
when O
we O
opened O
them O
! O

I O
love O
wearing O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
backwards O
when O
'm O
hanging O
out O
with O
friends O
. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
roller O
coaster O
that O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
around O
so O
much O
I O
felt O
bit O
dizzy O
afterward O
. O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
road O
trip O
for O
spring O
break O
and O
find O
cool O
Airbnb O
that O
located O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
all O
things O
we O
want O
to O
do O
. O

The O
rain O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
from O
the O
roof O
as O
we O
walked O
class O
. O

The O
coach O
wants O
us O
to O
do O
50 O
push-ups O
as O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
challenge O
at O
practice O
today O
- O
he O
must O
be O
kidding O
! O

Let O
's O
plan O
a O
road O
trip O
for O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
winter O
break O
! O

Let O
's O
meet O
in O
the O
mid-afternoon B-LITERAL
to O
grab O
some O
coffee O
and O
catch O
up O
on O
everything O
that O
been O
going O
. O

The O
coffee O
machine O
at O
school O
always O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
drip B-LITERAL
problem, O
leaving O
puddle O
on O
the O
counter O
every O
morning O
. O

I O
always O
order O
extra B-LITERAL
cheese O
on O
my O
pizza O
because O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
much O
cheese, O
right O
? O

We O
found O
an O
old O
lantern O
while O
camping O
and O
it O
surprisingly O
still O
worked O
when O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
. O

My O
sister O
collects O
vintage O
caps B-LITERAL
from O
different O
cities O
she O
visits O
. O

Whenever O
I O
sweat O
during O
a O
workout, O
my O
skin O
gets O
this O
weirdly O
salty B-LITERAL
feeling O
. O

Have O
you O
ever O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
match O
in O
complete O
darkness O
? O

I O
love O
it O
when O
icicles O
start O
to O
form O
and O
then O
slowly O
melt, O
creating O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
of O
water O
outside O
my O
window O
. O

The O
popcorn O
at O
the O
movie O
theater O
is O
always O
so O
buttery O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
- O
it O
's O
addictive O
! O

Be O
careful O
with O
that O
paint O
can O
; O
you O
don O
't O
want O
it O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
your O
new O
shoes O
! O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
getting O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
tutoring O
session O
for O
math, O
really O
need O
help O
with O
this O
chapter O
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
the O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
question O
on O
our O
last O
history O
test O
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
many O
cookie O
jars O
shook B-LITERAL
at O
the O
bake O
sale O
yesterday O
. O

We O
found O
this O
hidden O
spot O
in O
the O
woods O
where O
someone O
had O
already O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
small O
campfire O
before O
us O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
homemade O
chicken O
noodle O
soup O
is O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
hearty O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

My O
arms O
are O
sore O
from O
carrying O
all O
those O
wooden O
shooks B-LITERAL
to O
build O
our O
treehouse O
. O

My O
mom O
packed O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
sandwich O
for O
lunch O
today, O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
complaining O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
gathered O
around O
the O
fire O
pit O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
to O
keep O
us O
warm O
. O

My O
mom O
keeps O
telling O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
swim O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
I O
go O
swimming, O
but O
they O
always O
give O
hat O
hair O
! O

Right O
smack O
dab O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
Monday O
morning O
is O
probably O
my O
least O
favorite O
time O
during O
any O
week O
- O
who O
decided O
8 O
AM O
classes O
were O
a O
good O
idea O
? O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
grab O
lunch O
together O
sometime O
in O
the O
midday B-LITERAL
break O
between O
classes O
? O

My O
mom O
keeps O
trying O
to O
get O
me O
wear O
a O
sun O
protection O
hat O
instead O
of O
just O
regular O
old O
baseball-style O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
we O
go O
hiking O
. O

Before O
filling O
up O
another O
hogshead O
with O
pickles, O
Grandma O
made O
sure O
all O
her O
other O
jars O
were O
securely O
placed O
on O
their O
proper O
shooks B-LITERAL
in O
canning O
pantry O
shelves O
. O

The O
air O
conditioning O
unit O
has O
been O
leaking O
for O
days, O
causing O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
in O
our O
hallway O
. O

We O
finally O
finished O
our O
group O
project, O
and O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
me O
how O
well O
we O
worked O
together O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
nice O
when O
teachers O
give O
us O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
extra B-LITERAL
credit O
on O
exams O
. O

The O
restaurant O
down O
the O
street O
serves O
most O
perfectly O
seasoned O
and O
not O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
fries O
. O

My O
mom O
keeps O
telling O
me O
to O
wear O
a O
sun O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
I O
'm O
outside O
protect O
my O
face O
from O
getting O
sunburned O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
dripping B-LITERAL
water O
echoed O
throughout O
the O
cave O
as O
we O
ventured O
deeper O
into O
its O
mysterious O
depths O
. O

Last O
night O
's O
thunderstorm O
was O
so O
intense, O
it O
felt O
like O
the O
whole O
house O
shook B-LITERAL
with O
each O
thunderclap O
. O

The O
intense O
storm O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
trees O
in O
our O
backyard O
so O
violently O
that O
a O
few O
branches O
broke O
off O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
so O
many O
different O
projects O
right O
now, O
schoolwork O
is O
really O
piling O
up O
. O

I O
always O
wear O
a O
cap B-LITERAL
when O
playing O
tennis O
to O
shield O
my O
eyes O
from O
the O
sun O
. O

In O
video O
game O
tournaments, O
players O
often O
strategize O
how O
to O
dominate O
during O
mid-game B-LITERAL
secure O
victory O
by O
the O
end O
. O

Emma O
keeps O
losing O
her O
pen-caps B-LITERAL
all O
over O
class, O
which O
ones O
yours O
? O

Our O
soccer O
team O
is O
doing O
great O
this O
season O
; O
we O
're O
currently O
ranked O
as O
one O
of O
the O
top O
teams O
in O
our O
division O
at O
mid-season B-LITERAL
mark O
! O

In O
debate O
club, O
timing O
your O
points O
effectively O
is O
key O
; O
making O
strongest O
argument O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
can O
leave O
a O
lasting O
impact O
on O
judges O
. O

I O
always O
feel O
like O
need O
to O
put O
in O
extra B-LITERAL
effort O
math O
class O
keep O
up O
with O
everyone O
else O
. O

My O
dad O
always O
wears O
his O
lucky O
fishing O
cap B-LITERAL
whenever O
we O
go O
out O
on O
the O
boat O
. O

I O
love O
eating O
salty B-LITERAL
popcorn O
while O
watching O
movies O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

During O
our O
camping O
trip, O
we O
all O
gathered O
around O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
lanterns O
for O
a O
late-night O
hike O
. O

The O
sun O
is O
so O
bright, O
I O
definitely O
need O
to O
grab O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
we O
head O
out O
for O
a O
walk O
. O

I O
'm O
meeting O
my O
friends O
at O
the O
coffee O
shop O
around O
midday B-LITERAL
. O

The O
fries O
at O
that O
new O
restaurant O
are O
insanely O
crispy O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

We O
're O
right O
at O
the O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
school O
year O
already O
- O
time O
has O
been O
flying O
by O
so O
fast O
! O

I O
spilled O
water O
on O
my O
shirt O
and O
now O
it O
looks O
like O
have O
a O
huge O
drip B-LITERAL
mark O
down O
the O
front O
. O

After O
working O
out O
at O
practice, O
I O
always O
crave O
something O
savory O
and O
crunchy, O
preferably O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
like O
chips O
or O
pretzels O
. O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
as O
they O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
from O
roof O
outside O
my O
window O
. O

I O
prefer O
my O
snacks O
on O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
side O
rather O
than O
sweet O
. O

Our O
school O
dance O
theme O
this O
year O
is O
Under O
The O
Stars, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
held O
outside O
and O
I O
heard O
they O
'll O
have O
food O
trucks O
set O
up O
around O
midnight B-LITERAL
for O
snacks O
. O

I O
'm O
planning O
on O
starting O
my O
workout O
routine O
every O
morning O
during O
midthe B-LITERAL
week O
- O
hopefully O
that O
helps O
me O
stay O
consistent O
with O
fitness O
goals O
! O

The O
leaky O
roof O
caused O
constant O
drips B-LITERAL
into O
buckets O
placed O
around O
our O
house O
during O
heavy O
rainstorms O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
adding O
sea O
salt O
to O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
is O
weird, O
but O
I O
it O
makes O
them O
perfectly O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

As O
we O
hiked O
through O
the O
dense O
forest, O
could O
hear O
constant O
dripping B-LITERAL
of O
water O
from O
leaves O
after O
a O
heavy O
rainfall O
last O
night O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
was O
melting O
so O
quickly O
in O
the O
sun O
that O
it O
started O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
over O
my O
hands O
. O

My O
mom O
is O
going O
to O
be O
mad O
when O
she O
sees O
that O
paint O
has O
started O
drip B-LITERAL
onto O
her O
favorite O
rug O
while O
we O
were O
redecorating O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
much O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
that O
barrel O
of O
apples O
to O
get O
the O
best O
ones O
for O
pie O
. O

Do O
you O
prefer O
your O
margarita O
glasses O
rimmed O
with O
sugar O
or O
salt O
for O
that O
sweet O
and O
salty B-LITERAL
combination O
? O

It O
's O
important O
to O
drink O
lots O
of O
water O
after O
eating O
something O
really O
salty B-LITERAL
stay O
hydrated O
. O

The O
pretzels O
from O
that O
food O
truck O
are O
perfectly O
baked O
- O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
just O
a O
tad O
bit O
salty B-LITERAL

. O

This O
toggle O
cape B-LITERAL
coat O
will O
be O
perfect O
for O
our O
trip O
to O
the O
mountains O
next O
weekend O
; O
it O
keep O
me O
warm O
and O
stylish O
at O
same O
time O
! O

My O
dad O
insists O
on O
wearing O
his O
old-fashioned O
newsboy-style O
flat-cap B-LITERAL
everywhere O
he O
goes O
! O

My O
friend O
's O
birthday O
party O
was O
lit B-LITERAL
with O
all O
the O
decorations O
and O
music O
. O

The O
weather O
in O
the O
mid-fall B-LITERAL
is O
perfect O
for O
bonfires O
and O
hanging O
out O
with O
friends O
. O

Jake O
brought O
extras B-LITERAL
snacks O
to O
the O
movie O
night O
last O
night, O
he O
really O
knows O
how O
keep O
everyone O
well-fed O
and O
happy O
. O

As O
we O
admired O
our O
finished O
project, O
I O
couldn O
't O
help O
but O
marvel O
at O
how O
these O
simple O
wooden O
shooks B-LITERAL
had O
transformed O
into O
elegant O
furniture O
pieces O
. O

I O
like O
my O
margaritas O
with O
a O
salty B-LITERAL
rim O
- O
it O
really O
adds O
an O
extra O
kick O
to O
the O
drink O
. O

Where O
did O
you O
get O
that O
cool O
snapback O
cap B-LITERAL
? O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
sandwich O
is O
always O
the O
midsection B-LITERAL
where O
all O
toppings O
are O
. O

Our O
science O
experiment O
didn O
't O
go O
as O
planned O
when O
we O
tried O
to O
light O
the O
Bunsen O
burner O
and O
it O
wouldn O
stay O
lit B-LITERAL
. O

Planning O
a O
surprise O
party O
for O
Sarah O
is O
tricky O
since O
we O
have O
to O
find O
date O
that O
works O
everyone O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
's O
schedules O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
for O
a O
cute O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
wear O
the O
beach O
this O
summer O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
rain O
dripping B-LITERAL
outside O
is O
so O
soothing O
when O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
focus O
on O
studying O
. O

I O
've O
signed O
up O
for O
an O
art O
class O
that O
meets O
every O
Tuesday O
afternoon, O
right O
in O
my O
preferred O
creative O
space O
timeframe O
which O
is O
more O
towards O
late-midday B-LITERAL
than O
early O
morning O
! O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
what O
movie O
to O
watch O
tonight, O
maybe O
we O
should O
go O
for O
something O
light O
and O
funny O
instead O
of O
a O
heavy O
drama O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
. O

As O
we O
were O
walking O
through O
the O
forest, O
a O
loud O
thunderclap O
shook B-LITERAL
us O
to O
our O
core O
. O

The O
overall O
intensity O
level O
of O
sports O
matches O
always O
seems O
to O
rise O
during O
those O
crucial O
moments O
right O
at O
halftime O
or O
in O
the O
midst B-LITERAL
an O
intense O
rally O
! O

Do O
you O
know O
where O
I O
can O
find O
a O
cute O
cap B-LITERAL
to O
match O
my O
new O
sneakers O
? O

I O
need O
to O
go O
shopping O
for O
a O
new O
swim O
Cap O
soon O
! O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
wear O
my O
baseball O
cap B-LITERAL
backwards O
or O
forwards O
at O
the O
game O
tonight O
? O

When O
the O
icicles O
started O
to O
melt, O
they O
created O
a O
rhythmic O
drip B-LITERAL
outside O
my O
window O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
raindrops O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
against O
my O
window O
always O
helps O
me O
fall O
asleep O
at O
night O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
the O
bathroom O
has O
been O
causing O
a O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
sound O
all O
night O
. O

The O
window O
panes O
rattled O
and O
even O
our O
bedsheets O
shook B-LITERAL
from O
all O
that O
thunder O
. O

After O
dinner, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
in O
my O
bedroom O
to O
help O
me O
relax O
before O
going O
sleep O
. O

Can O
we O
schedule O
our O
study O
group O
session O
for O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
week O
? O

My O
favorite O
band O
is O
releasing O
their O
new O
album O
right O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
next O
month O
! O

After O
watching O
a O
documentary O
on O
ancient O
brewing O
techniques, O
I O
'm O
brainstorming O
ways O
to O
make O
my O
own O
backyard O
brewery O
complete O
with O
custom-built O
shooks B-LITERAL
for O
aging O
different O
types O
of O
beer O
! O

Be O
careful O
not O
to O
slip O
on O
any O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
water O
near O
the O
pool O
area O
; O
they O
can O
make O
things O
slippery O
! O

Let O
's O
avoid O
walking O
under O
that O
tree O
; O
its O
branches O
are O
dripping B-LITERAL
with O
leftover O
rainwater O
from O
last O
night O
storm O
. O

My O
mom O
bought O
me O
a O
cute O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
with O
pom-pom O
on O
top O
for O
the O
ski O
trip O
. O

We O
were O
so O
tired O
after O
we O
shook B-LITERAL
all O
the O
wooden O
staves O
for O
our O
school O
's O
theater O
set O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
should O
design O
custom O
caps B-LITERAL
for O
our O
friend O
group O
? O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
sandwich O
is O
the O
filling O
right O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
- O
like O
cheese O
or O
avocado O
! O

My O
uncle O
works O
at O
a O
brewery O
where O
they O
age O
their O
beer O
in O
oak O
barrels‚Äîit O
's O
crazy O
to O
think O
about O
all O
those O
containers O
getting O
shook B-LITERAL
around O
during O
production O
. O

The O
cafeteria O
always O
gives O
me O
extra B-LITERAL
fries O
when O
I O
order O
a O
meal, O
it O
's O
the O
little O
things O
that O
make O
my O
day O
. O

The O
faucet O
in O
my O
bathroom O
sink O
keeps O
dripping, O
and O
it O
's O
driving O
me O
crazy O
! O
dripping B-LITERAL

During O
the O
blackout, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
our O
backyard O
with O
string O
lights O
. O

Did O
you O
hear O
that O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
coming O
from O
the O
kitchen O
sink O
? O
We O
need O
to O
call O
a O
plumber O
ASAP O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
Sarah O
is O
always O
a O
bit O
extra B-LITERAL
when O
it O
comes O
to O
drama O
in O
our O
friend O
group O
- O
she O
loves O
being O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
. O

The O
painting O
was O
hung O
perfectly O
at O
the O
museum O
right O
in O
midst B-LITERAL
of O
other O
famous O
artworks O
. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
during O
the O
barbecue O
last O
weekend O
- O
it O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
! O

During O
the O
blackout, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
candles O
to O
brighten O
up O
room O
and O
play O
board O
games O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
'm O
in O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
a O
dilemma O
trying O
to O
decide O
which O
college O
apply O
. O

My O
grandma O
makes O
the O
best O
chocolate O
chip O
cookies O
- O
they O
're O
sweet O
and O
a O
little O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

We O
should O
start O
working O
on O
it O
now O
to O
be O
safe O
by O
our O
midway B-LITERAL
check-in O
progress O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
focus O
on O
studying O
when O
there O
are O
loud O
construction O
noises O
going O
right O
outside O
my O
window O
during O
this O
awkward O
mid-point B-LITERAL
of O
the O
day O
. O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
barrel O
at O
work O
today, O
and O
it O
shook B-LITERAL
everyone O
up O
in O
the O
office O
. O

The O
bookstore O
is O
usually O
bustling O
with O
students O
searching O
for O
textbooks O
right O
around O
midday B-LITERAL
on O
weekdays O
1 O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
cookies O
so O
we O
could O
have O
a O
lit B-LITERAL
snack O
during O
our O
study O
session O
. O

Remember O
when O
we O
all O
gathered O
around O
and O
collectively O
lit B-LITERAL
sparklers O
during O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
at O
Sarah‚Äôs O
house O
? O

When O
my O
brother O
and O
I O
were O
play-fighting, O
he O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
a O
bunch O
of O
cans O
that O
went O
rolling O
down O
the O
street O
in O
every O
direction O
- O
we O
both O
totally O
shook B-LITERAL
! O

I O
need O
to O
get O
a O
new O
winter O
cap B-LITERAL
before O
it O
gets O
too O
cold O
outside O
. O

Last O
night O
's O
dinner O
was O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
; O
I O
could O
hardly O
finish O
it O
. O

This O
pasta O
is O
a O
little O
bland O
and O
needs O
to O
be O
more O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Jake O
is O
being O
so O
dramatic O
about O
losing O
his O
phone O
charger, O
he O
's O
way O
too O
extra B-LITERAL
it O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
a O
bit O
salty B-LITERAL
today O
! O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
the O
backyard O
with O
fairy O
lights O
for O
party O
. O

The O
leaky O
faucet O
in O
the O
bathroom O
has O
been O
driving O
me O
crazy O
with O
its O
constant O
drip B-LITERAL
. O

The O
old O
cask O
we O
found O
in O
the O
basement O
was O
still O
filled O
with O
some O
shook B-LITERAL
headings O
. O

Being O
stuck O
in O
traffic O
during O
rush O
hour O
is O
the O
worst, O
especially O
when O
you O
're O
mid-text B-LITERAL
conversation O
. O

The O
fireplace O
crackled O
as O
we O
carefully O
lit B-LITERAL
each O
log O
to O
keep O
warm O
on O
that O
chilly O
evening O
. O

I O
always O
feel O
so O
tired O
after O
staying O
up O
late O
studying, O
maybe O
need O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
vitamins O
or O
something O
. O

Sometimes O
all O
I O
crave O
is O
a O
big, O
juicy O
burger O
with O
lots O
of O
melted O
cheese O
‚Äì O
even O
if O
it O
ends O
up O
being O
bit O
on O
the O
salty B-LITERAL
side O
! O

I O
accidentally O
knocked O
over O
my O
water O
bottle, O
causing O
it O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
all O
notes O
. O

Last O
summer O
camping O
trip, O
we O
used O
our O
survival O
skills O
to O
create O
shelter O
out O
of O
saplings O
and O
branches O
woven O
into O
makeshift O
barrels O
beneath O
which O
shook B-LITERAL
off O
sudden O
rainstorms O
. O

The O
pretzels O
from O
that O
bakery O
are O
always O
so O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
and O
crunchy O
. O

Last O
night, O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
roasted O
marshmallows O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
a O
bit O
tired O
today, O
so O
made O
myself O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
strong O
coffee O
to O
stay O
awake O
during O
class O
. O

Running O
late O
for O
class O
again O
. O
.I O
swear, O
it O
's O
like O
I O
have O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
talent O
being O
behind O
schedule O

After O
painting O
my O
room, O
there O
were O
drips B-LITERAL
of O
paint O
on O
the O
floor O
that O
I O
had O
to O
clean O
up O
. O

The O
sun O
is O
so O
bright O
today, O
I O
wish O
had O
remembered O
to O
bring O
my O
cap B-LITERAL
block O
out O
some O
of O
the O
rays O
. O

My O
mom O
made O
these O
really O
delicious O
homemade O
pretzels O
that O
were O
perfectly O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

You O
're O
being O
way O
too O
extra B-LITERAL
right O
now O
! O

My O
mom O
found O
out O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
my O
favorite O
scented O
candle O
in O
the O
living O
room O
without O
permission O
. O

My O
brother O
's O
lucky O
charm O
is O
his O
old, O
worn-out O
baseball O
Cap O
from O
little O
league O
. O

My O
mom O
always O
makes O
the O
best O
homemade O
salty B-LITERAL
pretzels O
‚Äì O
they O
're O
addictively O
delicious O
! O

Last O
night, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
some O
scented O
candles O
in O
room O
for O
a O
cozy O
hangout O
. O

There O
's O
a O
new O
cafe O
opening O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
town O
that O
we O
should O
check O
out O
sometime O
; O
I O
heard O
they O
have O
amazing O
desserts O
! O

The O
cafeteria O
worker O
was O
feeling O
generous O
and O
gave O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
serving O
of O
fries O
today, O
it O
a O
good O
day O
. O

The O
raindrops O
on O
the O
window O
created O
a O
beautiful O
drip B-LITERAL
effect O
as O
they O
slid O
down O
glass O
. O

Last O
night, O
I O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
candle O
in O
my O
room O
to O
create O
cozy O
vibe O
while O
studying O
. O

The O
fireworks O
display O
at O
the O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
party O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
sky O
beautifully O
. O

The O
potato O
chips O
in O
the O
vending O
machine O
are O
always O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
me O
. O

When O
we O
went O
hiking O
at O
dusk, O
knew O
our O
trek O
back O
would O
be O
dark O
so O
each O
of O
us O
pulled O
out O
flashlights O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
path O
through O
the O
forest O
trails O
. O

Bringing O
a O
bottle O
of O
water O
to O
school O
is O
essential O
in O
case O
your O
lunch O
ends O
up O
being O
extra O
spicy O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
! O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
rain O
dripping B-LITERAL
outside O
while O
study O
for O
exams O
; O
it O
's O
oddly O
comforting O
. O

I O
can O
't O
wait O
until O
the O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
semester O
when O
we O
have O
our O
week-long O
break, O
it O
'll O
be O
such O
a O
nice O
time O
to O
relax O
. O

Before O
leaving O
for O
vacation, O
my O
dad O
always O
reminds O
me O
not O
to O
forget O
and O
leave O
any O
lights O
still O
lit B-LITERAL
in O
room O
or O
bathroom O
alarm O
glowing O
since O
it O
's O
a O
waste O
of O
electricity O
can O
be O
dangerous O
sometimes O
too O
! O

I O
can O
't O
decide O
whether O
to O
go O
the O
party O
or O
study O
for O
my O
midterm B-LITERAL
exams, O
'm O
caught O
in O
mid O
of O
these O
two O
choices O
. O

Yesterday, O
we O
found O
a O
cask O
of O
old O
wine O
in O
the O
basement O
that O
was O
all O
shook B-LITERAL
up O
from O
being O
moved O
around O
. O

This O
morning, O
I O
accidentally O
left O
the O
porch O
light O
on O
; O
it O
was O
still O
lit B-LITERAL
when O
got O
home O
! O

I O
'm O
currently O
reading O
this O
amazing O
novel, O
and O
just O
reached O
the O
most O
intense O
point O
right O
in O
mid B-LITERAL
of O
book O
- O
it O
's O
so O
suspenseful O
! O

My O
energy O
levels O
are O
always O
at O
their O
peak O
during O
the O
midday, O
right O
before O
lunchtime O
. O
midday B-LITERAL

After O
painting O
my O
room, O
I O
noticed O
some O
paint O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
the O
floor O
that O
missed O
cleaning O
up O
. O

I O
lost O
my O
gym O
cap B-LITERAL
again O
; O
now, O
have O
no O
idea O
where O
it O
went O
. O

My O
dad O
's O
old O
trucker O
cap B-LITERAL
is O
now O
my O
lucky O
exam-taking O
hat O
- O
it O
helps O
me O
concentrate O
! O

Can O
you O
pass O
me O
the O
bag O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
chips O
? O

We O
watched O
a O
mesmerizing O
performance O
by O
group O
of O
dancers O
who O
used O
wooden O
staves O
as O
props, O
and O
they O
totally O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
stage O
! O

We O
all O
gathered O
around O
the O
campfire O
and O
lit B-LITERAL
marshmallows O
on O
sticks O
for O
s O
'mores O
during O
our O
camping O
trip O
. O

We O
finally O
fixed O
our O
broken O
lamp, O
so O
now O
living O
room O
is O
well-lit B-LITERAL
again O
. O

In O
science O
class O
today, O
we O
did O
an O
experiment O
where O
mixed O
different O
liquids O
together O
in O
a O
bottle O
which O
made O
them O
form O
layers O
- O
when O
I O
shook B-LITERAL
it O
all O
up O
vigorously, O
they O
combined O
into O
new O
color O
! O

My O
little B-LITERAL
brother O
accidentally O
set O
his O
toy O
on O
fire O
when O
he O
used O
a O
magnifying O
glass O
to O
focus O
the O
sunlight O
until O
it O
lit O
up O
. O

The O
Christmas O
tree O
looked O
so O
beautiful O
once O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
all O
the O
ornaments O
and O
lights O
. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
allow O
us O
to O
wear O
caps B-LITERAL
indoors O
at O
school, O
my O
hair O
is O
a O
mess O
today O
! O

I O
can O
't O
eat O
ramen O
noodles O
without O
adding O
some O
extra O
chili O
flakes O
and O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
for O
that O
spicy, O
salty B-LITERAL
kick O
. O

We O
should O
go O
check O
it O
out O
together, O
maybe O
meet O
there O
around O
four O
or O
five O
o O
'clock O
when O
's O
not O
too O
crowded O
but O
still O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
day O
. O

I O
love O
getting O
fries O
with O
extra O
salt O
on O
them O
so O
they O
're O
super O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

After O
the O
rainstorm, O
there O
was O
a O
steady O
drip B-LITERAL
from O
edge O
of O
roof O
onto O
pavement O
below O
. O

The O
workers O
shook B-LITERAL
each O
barrel O
before O
sealing O
them O
up O
to O
make O
sure O
nothing O
was O
loose O
inside O
. O

The O
dancers O
really O
shook B-LITERAL
those O
tambourine O
staves O
during O
the O
performance O
. O

I O
think O
they O
'll O
give O
me O
that O
extra B-LITERAL
boost O
need O
. O

I O
heard O
they O
're O
doing O
something O
special O
with O
extra B-LITERAL
fireworks O
after O
the O
team O
scores O
a O
touchdown O
. O

The O
ice O
cream O
cone O
was O
melting O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
created O
a O
huge O
drip B-LITERAL
on O
the O
sidewalk O

My O
friend O
lit B-LITERAL
a O
bonfire O
at O
the O
beach O
and O
we O
roasted O
marshmallows O
over O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
feeling O
pretty O
stressed O
with O
exams O
coming O
up, O
but O
hanging O
out O
you O
guys O
brings O
some O
much-needed O
relief O
in O
my O
stressful O
week O
ahead O
at O
least O
partially O
amidst B-LITERAL
anxiety O
and O
worry O
. O
1 O
have O
a O
test O
tomorrow, O
so O
studying O
the O
mid-afternoon O

We O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
some O
fireworks O
during O
the O
Fourth O
of O
July O
celebration O
in O
our O
town O
. O

I O
can O
't O
stand O
when O
food O
is O
too O
salty, O
it O
ruins O
the O
whole O
meal O
for O
me O
. O
salty B-LITERAL

I O
can O
't O
believe O
shook B-LITERAL
the O
barrel O
of O
pickles O
to O
mix O
them O
up O
before O
making O
my O
sandwich O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
sip O
from O
my O
water O
bottle O
discreetly, O
but O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
loud O
drip B-LITERAL
as O
some O
spilled O
on O
desk O
during O
class O
. O

That O
pasta O
dish O
was O
way O
too O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
taste, O
it O
felt O
like O
I O
eating O
a O
spoonful O
of O
salt O
! O

Tom O
brought O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
set O
of O
notes O
to O
share O
with O
the O
group O
before O
our O
exam O
tomorrow O
. O

My O
grandma O
's O
homemade O
pickle O
recipe O
is O
perfectly O
tangy O
and O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
. O

Our O
group O
effort O
really O
paid O
off O
when O
we O
successfully O
rolled O
out O
that O
massive O
shook B-LITERAL
onto O
the O
loading O
dock O
! O

We O
went O
camping O
last O
weekend, O
and O
we O
sat O
around O
the O
campfire O
'd O
lit B-LITERAL
to O
keep O
warm O
. O

The O
canned O
tomato O
soup O
tasted O
too O
processed O
and O
overly O
salty B-LITERAL
for O
my O
liking O
. O

My O
favorite O
part O
of O
a O
sandwich O
is O
definitely O
the O
mid-section B-LITERAL
where O
all O
fillings O
are O
perfectly O
balanced O
. O

Do O
you O
prefer O
sweet O
or O
salty B-LITERAL
snacks O
during O
study O
sessions O
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
how O
salty B-LITERAL
the O
ocean O
water O
is O
today O
; O
it O
stings O
my O
eyes O
. O

My O
little B-LITERAL
brother O
got O
scared O
when O
he O
accidentally O
lit O
a O
match O
before O
we O
could O
stop O
him O
. O

The O
restaurant O
accidentally O
gave O
me O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
order O
of O
fries, O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
too O
full O
to O
finish O
them O
all O
! O

The O
fireworks O
display O
at O
the O
park O
was O
so O
beautiful O
; O
they O
had O
really O
lit B-LITERAL
up O
sky O
! O

Be O
careful O
with O
that O
popsicle O
- O
it O
's O
already O
starting O
to O
drip B-LITERAL
down O
your O
hand O
! O

The O
peaceful O
rhythm O
of O
water O
dripping B-LITERAL
into O
the O
fountain O
always O
makes O
this O
spot O
at O
school O
so O
relaxing O
. O

After O
painting O
my O
room, O
I O
noticed O
some O
paint O
drips B-LITERAL
on O
the O
floor O
that O
need O
to O
clean O
up O
later O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
puddle O
forming O
under O
the O
eaves O
where O
rainwater O
would O
constantly O
drip B-LITERAL
during O
storms O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
worth O
paying O
the O
fee O
for O
an O
extra B-LITERAL
carry-on O
bag O
on O
our O
trip O
? O

When O
I O
go O
out O
for O
sushi, O
always O
order O
a O
seaweed O
salad O
with O
salty B-LITERAL
dressing O
. O

Whenever O
it O
rains O
heavily, O
our O
backyard O
turns O
into O
one O
big O
puddle O
with O
drips B-LITERAL
falling O
from O
every O
direction O
. O

The O
jack-o-lanterns O
we O
lit B-LITERAL
for O
Halloween O
looked O
so O
spooky O
in O
the O
dark O
! O

Have O
you O
seen O
those O
trendy O
bucket O
caps B-LITERAL
everyone O
is O
wearing O
? O

It O
's O
crazy O
how O
something O
as O
simple O
a O
walk O
during O
these O
warm O
evenings O
can O
just O
put O
you O
right O
into O
relaxing O
mood O
in O
the O
middle B-LITERAL
of O
stress O
and O
chaos O
. O

Whenever O
I O
make O
popcorn O
at O
home, O
always O
add O
extra O
butter O
and O
a O
sprinkle O
of O
salty B-LITERAL
seasoning O
. O

I O
need O
to O
add O
some O
extra B-LITERAL
accessories O
make O
it O
pop O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
the O
fries O
from O
that O
food O
truck O
were O
so O
salty, O
had O
to O
gulp O
down O
a O
whole O
bottle O
of O
water O
! O
salty B-LITERAL

When O
I O
opened O
that O
old O
storage O
unit, O
a O
bunch O
of O

spilled O

extra B-SLANG
sometimes O
. O

My O
mood O
is O
feeling O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
today O
; O
neither O
happy O
nor O
sad, O
just O
in O
between O
. O

It O
's O
literally B-SLANG
the O
most O
lit O
thing O
I O
've O
ever O
watched O
. O

She O
went O
full-on O
diva O
mode O
at O

today, O
demanding O
everyone O
listen O
to O
her O
story O
‚Äì O
talk O
about O
dramatic O
and O
unnecessarily O
extra B-SLANG
! O

I O
can O
't O
stand O
when O
people O
try O
to O
cap B-SLANG
on O
others O
just O
make O
themselves O
feel O
superior O
. O

Getting O

A O

I O
never O

but O
they O
just O
asked O

instead O
- O
talk O
about O
being O

The O
way O
Jacob O
combines O
streetwear O
with O
high O
fashion O
in O
his O
outfits O
creates O
a O
unique O
kind O
of O
drip B-SLANG

It O
's O
pointless O
to O
be O
all O
salty B-SLANG
about O
not O
being O
selected O
for O

king O
or O

; O

Getting O

why O
she O
's O
being O
so O
salty B-SLANG
towards O
me O
lately O
; O
did O
do O
something O
wrong O
? O

Stop O
trying O
to O
act O
all O
tough, O
we O
both O
know O
it O
's O
just O
cap B-SLANG
coming O
from O
you O
. O

Why O
is O
David O
always O
so O
salty B-SLANG
when O
he O
loses O

basketball O
? O

I O
'm O
hoping O
to O
go O
that O
music O
festival O
next O
month O
; O
know O
it O
's O
going O
be O
super O
lit B-SLANG

Honestly, O
I O
have O
zero O
time O
for O
people O
who O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
constantly O
cap B-SLANG
on O
others O
just O
better O
about O
themselves O
. O

Trying O
to O
find O
the O
perfect O
balance O
between O
casual O
and O
formal O
for O
this O
interview O
outfit O
while O
keeping O
it O

The O

has O
got O
me O
feeling O
seriously O
shook B-SLANG
right O
now O

Jake O
is O
always O
capping B-SLANG
about O
his O
basketball O
skills, O
but O
we O
all O
know O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
when O
people O
use O
veiled O
compliments O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
capping B-SLANG
on O
my O
hair O
or O
clothes O
. O

Everyone O
's O
reaction O
to O
my O
singing O
during O
karaoke O
night O
left O
me O
absolutely O
shook B-SLANG
- O
in O
a O

I O
swear O
Sarah O

when O
we O
all O
barely O

It O
's O

. O

That O
test O
was O
so O
much O
harder O
than O
expected, O
it O
really O
had O
me O
shook B-SLANG
. O

The O
weather O
forecast O
predicted O

my O

of O
hitting O

this O
weekend O
to O
pick O
some O
new O
drip B-SLANG
for O
summer O
. O

Seeing O
my O

someone O
new O
on O

mid B-SLANG

Don O

because O
I O

I O
can O

When O

the O
whole O
neighborhood O
heard O
him O
scream O
- O
he O
can O

been O
so O
unpredictable, O
like O
one O

and O
the O

Stop O

admit O
that O
you O
were O
too O

last O

my O

The O
way O
she O
styled O
her O
hair O
is O
giving O
me O
major O
drip B-SLANG
envy O
. O

Going O
to O
Coachella O
next O
year O
would O
be O
so O

imagine O
all O
the O
amazing O
performances O
! O
lit B-SLANG

I O
thought O
about O
going O
to O
the O
party O
tonight, O
but O
honestly, O
vibe O
seems O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
so O
might O
just O
stay O
in O
. O

The O
new O
Avengers O
movie O
was O
absolutely O
lit B-SLANG

Finding O
out O
that O
we O
have O
a O
substitute O
teacher O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
week O
has O
everyone O
in O
class O
pretty O
shook B-SLANG
. O

Why O
do O
people O
always O
have O
to O
make O
everything O
so O
extra B-SLANG
on O
social O
media O
? O

That O
outfit O
is O

no O
cap B-SLANG

I O
heard O
there O
's O
a O
music O
festival O
happening O
next O
month O
- O
imagine O
how O
lit B-SLANG
that O
would O
be O
? O

It O
's O
funny O
how O
some O
people O
get O
so O
salty B-SLANG
over O
small O
things O
like O
someone O
not O
liking O
their O
post O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
overall, O
only O
a O
couple O
of O
decent O
songs O
on O
there O
. O

I O
think O
the O
new O
song O
from O
that O
artist O
is O
just O
really O
mid, O
nothing O
special O
. O
mid B-SLANG

The O
way O
she O
stood O
up O
to O
that O
bully O
had O
everyone O
in O
class O
shook B-SLANG
. O

I O
can O
't O
deal O
with O
his O
extra B-SLANG
behavior O
when O
he O
doesn O
get O
way O
. O

Ugh, O
Sarah O
is O
being O
so O
extra B-SLANG
about O
not O
getting O
the O
exact O
shade O
of O

Why O
is O
she O
acting O
so O
extra B-SLANG
just O
because O
he O
liked O
another O
girl‚Äôs O
Instagram O
photo O
? O

Honestly, O
I O
feel O
like O
having O
good O
music O
taste O
is O
just O
as O
important O
fashion O
sense O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
showing O
off O
your O
drip, O
you O
know O
? O
drip B-SLANG

Watching O
those O
dancers O
move O
with O
such O
fluidity O
and O
style O
just O
proves O
they O
've O
got O
that O
next-level O
drip B-SLANG
. O

Did O
you O
see O
Sarah O

When O

Why O

Her O

lit B-SLANG

Bro, O

like O
it O
had O
some O

scenes O

When O
my O

I O

It O

This O

I O
can O

Jacob O

The O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
getting O
some O

Can O
we O
all O
agree O
to O
stop O
capping B-SLANG
and O
just O
be O
honest O
with O
each O
other O
for O
once O
? O

When O

Sam O

that O
insane O
stunt, O
everyone O
watching O
was O
shook B-SLANG
. O

This O
week O
's O
weather O
forecast O
is O
looking O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
- O
can O
't O
decide O
if O
it O
'll O
be O
sunny O
or O
rainy O
half O
the O
time O
. O

Ugh, O
that O
new O
movie O
was O
so O
mid, O
I O
expected O
more O
action O
. O
mid B-SLANG

Why O
are O
some O
people O
so O
dramatic O
and O
extra B-SLANG
over O
such O
small O
things O
? O

Ugh, O
why O
is O
she O
so O
salty B-SLANG
just O
because O
I O
got O
a O
better O
grade O
on O
the O
test O
? O

Man, O
did O
you O
see O
Jake O
's O
new O
drip B-SLANG
at O
the O
party O
last O
night O
? O

That O
party O
last O
night O
was O
so O
lit, O
I O
can O
't O
believe O
we O
danced O
until O
sunrise O
! O
lit B-SLANG

Seeing O
my O
ex O
with O
someone O
new O
at O
the O
party O
left O
me O
feeling O
pretty O
dang O
shook, O
to O
be O
honest O
. O
shook B-SLANG

She O
had O
major O
drip B-SLANG
with O
those O
designer O
sneakers O
. O

She O
tried O
to O
tell O
me O
she O
wasn O
't O
at O
the O
party O
last O
night, O
but O
that O
's O
a O
fat O
cap B-SLANG
because O
I O
saw O
her O
dancing O
on O
tables O
. O

The O
weather O
today O
is O
so O
mid, O
not O
too O
hot O
or O
cold O
but O
still O
kinda O
boring O
. O
mid B-SLANG

Honestly, O
I O
'm O
over O
all O
this O
unnecessary O
drama O
and O
constant O
cappin B-SLANG
' O
from O
certain O
friends O
. O

Last O
night O
's O
party O
was O
so O
lit, O
the O
music O
on O
point O
and O
everyone O
having O
a O
great O
time O
! O
lit B-SLANG

My O
last O
test O
grade O
was O
so O
mid, O
I O
thought O
aced O
it O
but O
ended O
up O
just O
passing O
. O
mid B-SLANG

Don O
't O
be O
salty B-SLANG
just O
because O
your O
crush O
didn O
text O
you O
back O
. O

I O
was O
shook B-SLANG
when O
found O
out O
! O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
she O
's O
still O
salty B-SLANG
about O
what O
happened O
at O
the O
party O
last O
weekend O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
Kyle O
to O
pick O
a O
restaurant O
for O
dinner, O
he O
was O
being O
super O
extra, O
listing O
off O
dozen O
different O
places O
none O
of O
us O
had O
even O
heard O
. O
extra B-SLANG

We O
were O
all O
so O
lit B-SLANG
at O
Sarah O
's O
birthday O
party O
! O

I O
'm O
feeling O
confident O
in O
this O
outfit, O
think O
it O
's O
giving O
off O
major O
drip B-SLANG
vibes O
. O

How O
do O
you O
manage O
to O
have O
such O
consistent O
drip B-SLANG
every O
day O
? O

I O
have O
a O
feeling O
this O
semester O
is O
going O
to O
be O
straight-up O
mid B-SLANG
with O
all O
these O
assignments O
piling O
up O
. O

He O
made O
such O
an O
over-the-top O
grand O
gesture O
just O
to O
ask O
her O
out O
on O
a O
date O
; O
talk O
about O
being O
unnecessarily O
extra B-SLANG
. O

Why O
do O
people O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
constantly O
spew O
out O
cap B-SLANG
? O

It O
looks O
so O
lit B-SLANG
! O

Let O
me O
know O
if O
anyone O
starts O
spreading O
cap B-SLANG
about O
. O

I O
swear O
Jessica O
has O
been O
acting O
so O
extra B-SLANG
lately O
over O
every O
little O
thing O
that O
doesn O
't O
go O
her O
way O
. O

You O
need O
to O
stop O
being O
so O
salty B-SLANG
and O
just O
move O
on O
from O
what O
happened O
last O
week O
. O

Why O

? O

Taylor O
is O

her O
elaborate O
skincare O
routine, O
like O
girl, O
it O
doesn O
't O
have O
to O
be O
that O
complicated O
. O

I O
thought O
about O
getting O
a O
pet O
fish O
but O
then O
realized O
they O
're O
kinda O
mid B-SLANG
as O
far O
being O
entertaining O

I O

't O
wait O
for O

Finding O

I O
failed O
my O
math O

Can O
we O
have O
one O
conversation O
without O
someone O
getting O
all O
extra B-SLANG
and O
starting O
an O
argument O
? O

I O
was O
shook B-SLANG
when O
my O
crush O
actually O
asked O
me O

on O
a O

! O

My O
outfit O

I O

a O
new O

on O
Netflix O
and O
so O
far O
it O
's O
been O
really O
mid B-SLANG
- O
hoping O

! O

Our O
group O
Halloween O
costumes O
are O
going O
to O
be O
lit O
this O
year O
- O
coordinated O
dripping B-SLANG
in O
style O
! O

I O
could O
tell O
by O
his O
tone O
of O
voice O
that O
he O
was O
feeling O
pretty O
salty B-SLANG
about O
not O
winning O
first O
place O
in O
the O
competition O
. O

My O
outfit O
for O
the O
party O
tonight O
is O
looking O
a O
little O
mid, O
I O
might O
need O
to O
switch O
things O
up O
. O
mid B-SLANG

Just O
watched O
the O
finale O
of O
that O
TV O
show O
and O
wow, O
talk O
about O
a O
super O
disappointing O
ending O
- O
majorly O
mid B-SLANG
vibes O
all O
around O
! O

Why O
you O
always O
gotta O
come O
at O
me O
with O
those O
weak O
caps B-SLANG
? O

It O
was O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
for O
me O
; O
nothing O
too O
exciting O
happened O
. O

It O
's O
got O
such O
a O
cool O
drip B-SLANG
to O
it O
. O

I O
just O
watched O
that O
movie O
everyone O
was O
talking O
about, O
and O
honestly, O
it O
so O
mid B-SLANG
. O

She O
took O
it O
to O
a O
whole O
new O
level O
of O
extra B-SLANG
by O
creating O
drama O
out O
nothing O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
when O
people O
get O
all O
salty B-SLANG
over O
little O
things O
like O
this O
. O

Why O
are O
you O
being O
all O
salty B-SLANG
? O

I O
just O
got O
tickets O
to O
the O
music O
festival O
next O
month, O
know O
it O
's O
gonna O
be O
one O
of O
most O
lit B-SLANG
events O
year O
. O

I O
need O
to O
up O
my O
shoe O
game O
if O
want O
have O
serious O
drip B-SLANG
like O
those O
guys O
over O
there O
. O

You O
think O
you O
can O
just O
keep O
capping B-SLANG
on O
me O
without O
any O
consequences O
? O

She O
keeps O
changing O
her O
story O
every O
time O
she O
gets O
caught O
up O
in O
some O
new O
lie O
; O
absolute O
masterclass O
capping B-SLANG
right O
there O
! O

The O
concert O
we O
went O
to O
last O
weekend O
was O
absolutely O
lit B-SLANG
- O
the O
energy O
insane O
. O

Going O
thrift O
shopping O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
find O
unique O
pieces O
for O
your O
drip B-SLANG
without O
breaking O
bank O
. O

Honestly, O
I O
think O
everyone O
gets O
too O
caught O
up O
in O
being O
all O
salty B-SLANG
over O
social O
media O
drama O
instead O
of O
actually O
enjoying O
life O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
shook B-SLANG
from O
that O
crazy O
party O
last O
night O
. O

Why O
is O
everyone O
getting O
so O
worked O
up O
and O
being O
all O
kinds O
of O
extra B-SLANG
over O
who O
sits O
where O
at O
lunch O
? O

I O
was O
so O
shook B-SLANG
by O
the O
plot O
twist O
at O
end O
. O

Jenny O
has O
been O
super O
salty B-SLANG
ever O
since O
she O
found O
out O
got O
a O
lower O
grade O
than O
her O
friend O
. O

I O
can O
't O
deal O
with O
all O
the O
extra B-SLANG
homework O
teacher O
assigned O
this O
weekend, O
like O
seriously O
! O

Stop O
cappin B-SLANG
' O
that O
you O
're O
not O
into O
them O
when O
it O
's O
obvious O
have O
a O
crush O
. O

I O
tried O
that O
new O
restaurant O
downtown O
last O
night, O
and O
honestly, O
the O
food O
was O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
. O

I O
was O
shook B-SLANG
when O
she O
walked O
into O
class O
today O
! O

He O
seems O
extra O
salty B-SLANG
today, O
maybe O
something O
happened O
that O
we O
don‚Äôt O
know O
about O
yet O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Jake O
is O
still O
salty B-SLANG
about O
that O
argument O
we O
had O
last O
week O
. O

That O
new O
track O
by O
Drake O
is O
straight O
fire O
- O
it O
's O
definitely O
adding O
some O
serious O
drip B-SLANG
to O
my O
playlist O
. O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
they O
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
cap B-SLANG
on O
my O
taste O
in O
music O
like O
that O
. O

The O
way O
Jim O
dresses O
just O
screams O
drip B-SLANG
- O
he O
always O
looks O
so O
cool O
. O

Seeing O
how O
much O
weight O
Tim O
lost O
over O
the O
summer O
had O
us O
all O
really O
shook B-SLANG
. O

The O
party O
last O
night O
was O
pretty O
mid, O
nothing O
too O
exciting O
happened O
. O
mid B-SLANG

I O
see O
right O
through O
Mark O
's O
caps B-SLANG
about O
being O
too O
busy O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
us O
this O
weekend O
. O

It O
's O
full O
of O
insane O
drip B-SLANG
. O

Seriously, O
why O
does O
she O
have O
to O
be O
so O
ridiculously O
extra B-SLANG
about O
everything O
? O

My O
lunch O
today O
was O
so O
mid, O
I O
wish O
had O
grabbed O
something O
else O
. O
mid B-SLANG

I O
can O
't O
believe O
Sarah O
got O
all O
extra B-SLANG
when O
accidentally O
ate O
one O
of O
her O
fries O
. O

Why O
is O
Sarah O
being O
so O
extra B-SLANG
about O
her O
crush O
not O
texting O
back O
? O

She O
was O
super O
salty B-SLANG
when O
she O
found O
out O
her O
crush O
asked O
someone O
else O
to O
prom O
. O

The O
weather O
forecast O
says O
it O
's O
gonna O
be O
mid B-SLANG
tomorrow O
- O
not O
too O
hot O
or O
cold O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
concert O
would O
be O
amazing, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
overall O
. O

The O
beach O
bonfire O
last O
weekend O
was O
crazy O
fun O
- O
good O
tunes, O
vibes, O
just O
overall O
super O
lit B-SLANG
! O

Taylor O
's O
party O
last O

was O
fun O
overall, O
but O
the O
music O
playlist O
she O
had O
playing O
definitely O
on O
more O
mid B-SLANG
side O
. O

I O
can O
't O
stand O
people O
who O
constantly O
cap B-SLANG
just O
to O
impress O
others O
. O

When O
she O
told O
me O
got O
accepted O
into O
her O
dream O
college, O
I O
was O
genuinely O
shook B-SLANG
‚Äì O
in O
a O
good O
way O
! O

Jenna O
was O
really O
salty B-SLANG
when O
she O
saw O
her O
ex O

a O
new O
girlfriend O

the O
mall O
. O

The O
food O
at O
that O
restaurant O
was O
surprisingly O

I O

doesn O
't O
stop O
being O
so O
extra B-SLANG
about O
wanting O

'm O
gonna O
lose O

I O
heard O
that O
new O
restaurant O
in O
town O
is O
really O
good, O
we O
should O
check O
it O
out O
and O
see O
if O
the O
food O
as O

they O
say O
. O

I O
went O
to O
a O
party O
last O
night O
and O
it O
was O
okay O
guess O
- O
pretty O
mid B-SLANG
overall O
. O

Ugh, O

I O
need O

I O
spent O
hours O

The O

When O
my O

I O
was O

Seeing O

in O
theaters O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
making O
me O
get O
a O
part-time O
job O
this O
summer O
to O
save O
up O
for O
college, O
but O
I O
just O
want O
relax O
by O
the O
pool O
all O
day O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
Ms O
. O
Johnson O
is O
going O
to O
assign O
us O
any O
homework O
over O
the O
long O
weekend O
? O

The O
concert O
last O
night O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
! O

The O
band O
played O
all O
of O
my O
favorite O
songs O
. O

Ugh, O
my O
phone O
battery O
died O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
texting O
crush O
last O
night O
. O

Have O
you O
started O
thinking O
about O
what O
colleges O
want O
to O
apply O
yet O
? O

It O
's O
so O
overwhelming O
trying O
to O
narrow O
down O
your O
choices O
. O

Why O
does O
math O
have O
to O
be O
so O
difficult O
? O

I O
swear O
algebra O
makes O
no O
sense O
sometimes O
. O

Can O
't O
believe O
prom O
is O
only O
a O
month O
away O
! O

Have O
you O
found O
a O
dress O
yet O
? O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
the O
history O
test O
is O
tomorrow, O
feel O
so O
unprepared O
. O

Did O
you O
watch O
the O
new O
episode O
of O
that O
drama O
series O
everyone O
's O
talking O
about O
? O

The O
cafeteria O
food O
is O
seriously O
questionable, O
I O
think O
'll O
just O
bring O
lunch O
from O
home O
tomorrow O
. O

Have O
you O
started O
thinking O
about O
what O
colleges O
want O
to O
apply O
? O

I O
'm O
so O
over O
this O
weather, O
wish O
it O
would O
finally O
warm O
up O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
should O
plan O
a O
movie O
night O
this O
weekend O
? O

There O
's O
a O
new O
comedy O
out O
that O
looks O
hilarious O
. O

My O
parents O
are O
driving O
me O
crazy O
with O
all O
their O
rules O
lately, O
it O
's O
like O
they O

practically O
an O
adult O

. O

Have O
you O
heard O
about O
that O
new O
band O
coming O
to O
town O
? O

Their O
music O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
amazing O
live O
. O

Ugh, O
my O
phone O
keeps O
acting O
up O
and O
freezing O
at O
the O
worst O
times O
. O

Last O

that O
viral O
TikTok O

seriously O
needs O
to O
step O
up O
their O
game O
with O
the O
food O
options, O
everything O
tastes O
like O

lately O

? O

I O
heard O

. O

The O
soccer O
game O

Our O

a O
win O
in O
overtime O
- O
it O

! O

I O

been O
improving O

I O
have O
a O
major O
crush O
on O
someone O
in O
my O
history O
class, O
but O
'm O
too O
nervous O
to O

. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
starting O
a O
book O
club O
with O
our O
friends O
? O

It O
could O
be O
a O
fun O
way O
to O
stay O
connected O
and O
read O
more O
often O
. O

Can O
you O
believe O
prom O

on O

last O
night, O
couldn O
't O
stop O
watching O
. O

The O
gym O
has O
been O
so O
crowded O
lately, O
I O

workout O
routine O

finally O
finished O

a O

to O
choose O
. O

My O

I O
wish O
we O
had O
more O
freedom O
in O

to O
choose O
our O
own O
classes O
instead O
of O
following O
a O
set O
schedule O
every O
year O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
excited O
for O
summer O
break, O
already O
have O
plans O
to O
travel O
with O
my O
friends O
and O
go O
on O
road O
trips O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
we O
'll O
have O
any O
snow O
days O
this O
winter O
? O

I O
could O
really O
use O
some O
extra O
time O
off O
from O
school O
. O

My O
favorite O
hobby O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
painting O
; O
it O
's O
been O
such O
a O
relaxing O
way O
to O
unwind O
after O
long O
day O
.‚Äù O

I O
can O
't O
believe O
we O
have O
another O
test O

tomorrow, O
this O
unit O
is O

hard O
to O
understand O
. O

Did O
you O
hear O

up O
their O
lunch O
options, O
I O
'm O
getting O
tired O
of O
the O

much O
homework, O
barely O
have O
time O

anything O
else O
after O
school O

Have O
you O
started O

The O
struggle O

. O

Have O
